/**
 * ESLint Configuration for Next.js Project
 * 
 * This configuration extends Next.js core web vitals rules and includes
 * the React Compiler plugin for build-time optimizations.
 * 
 * @plugin react-compiler - The React Compiler (formerly React Forget) plugin
 *   that enables automatic memoization and optimization of React components.
 * 
 * @rule react-compiler/react-compiler: "error"
 *   This rule enforces that your code follows patterns compatible with the
 *   React Compiler. When set to "error", ESLint will:
 *   - Flag code that violates React's rules (e.g., mutating props, breaking
 *     rules of hooks, side effects during render)
 *   - Identify patterns that prevent the compiler from optimizing components
 *   - Ensure components can be safely auto-memoized by the compiler
 * 
 *   The React Compiler analyzes your code at build time and automatically
 *   inserts useMemo, useCallback, and memo() calls where beneficial,
 *   eliminating the need for manual memoization while improving performance.
 *   Setting this to "error" ensures all code is compiler-compatible.
