The Giddy Goat Coffee Roasters | South End,checked,Outdoor Outlets,Coffee Shop,Large,South End,"3001 Griffith St, Charlotte, NC 28203",ChIJwXKZRl6fVogR2Ds_snOk6DA,https://maps.google.com/?cid=3524247525236095960,"https://maps.apple.com/?ll=35.199836,-80.8705116&q=The%20Giddy%20Goat%20Coffee%20Roasters%20%7C%20South%20End",Yes,"Free,Street,Paid,Lot",Yes,No,Yes,Yes,"Spacious and stylish coffee shop in South End with a bright, modern interior and a laid-back community feel. Known for its excellent coffee, fresh empanadas, and friendly staff. ","This is their newest location in South End, with the original spot still going strong in Plaza Midwood. This one completely lives up to the hype. Honestly, I’d go so far as to say it’s the best place to hang out in South End if you’re a remote worker, a student, or just someone looking for a spot to plop down with your laptop.

Access to outlets is tremendous. Truly 10/10. You can tell there was an intentional effort to make it easy to stay charged, and I love whoever made that decision. There’s plenty of seating both inside and out, and the outdoor setup is quality. There’s a ground-level patio and an upstairs patio, and both have outlets. Outdoors! They even have the little plastic covers to keep them protected from the elements, so you can sit in the sun, plug in, and just relax.

They’ve got pastries (no cinnamon rolls, unfortunately) but some solid options, plus empanadas and other grab-and-go bites. It’s already a popular remote work spot. Every time I’ve been, there’s a steady group of people hanging out, working, and enjoying the space. The design is excellent, with plenty of room to spread out, good energy, and great coffee. I’m more of a tea person, but they’ve got that too, with some solid choices.

The only real concern is parking. There’s free street parking, but this is South End, so it’s limited, and apartments nearby make it competitive. There are some paid lots further down the street if needed.

The upstairs patio is also a great place to read on a warm day, with solid views and a calm atmosphere. Overall, this is an incredible addition to the South End coffee shop scene. I’d choose this place over nearby Not Just Coffee, Stable Hand, Salted Melon, and even Suffolk Punch, which has long been one of my favorites in the area. It’s that good.",https://www.giddygoat.com/,35.199836,-80.8705116,"['https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-smRy6G3oUW0DCmCBpzy6ouwyrFrP-fqT7lZD=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOU6Cag_kSkQ1zL1eOu8IKhgibxuwihAKj0D6vp=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNT7W4nXTNHlA11SfluYxwGWyjkcb8fUjX1b0nz=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2tUSBz51cmSAuaZgp25O2WG8A5NqqAUgY-bYH=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOx-NN_4LmCwEhfE1eX6siSIxGv_H-ateCgm8V=w2048-h2048-k-no']",,https://www.tiktok.com/@giddycoffee,https://www.instagram.com/giddycoffee/,,https://www.facebook.com/GiddyCoffee/,https://x.com/GiddyCoffee,,11/20/2025 9:35am,11/19/2025 6:02pm,,11/19/2025 6:14pm

From its breathtaking scenery to its history that dates back to the beginning of man. Yemen is the homeland of our family. As first-generation immigrants, we wanted to honor our heritage.

Yemen is where coffee was invented and later flourished in global trade. Roasting and serving coffee is something that is inclusive of all people and cultures and brings people together. Our coffee is grown from altitudes over 3,000 ft in a mountainous village called Haraz, where our namesake originates.","As beautiful as all their other locations. This one is now my favorite compared to their Elizabeth and LoSo spots since parking is super easy (it's in a shopping complex with a huge lot), and access to outlets is truly marvelous. 10/10. There was an intentional effort here to make sure people coming to work on laptops or study could stay charged up and I appreciate it.

Aside from that, if you've been to any of their other locations and enjoyed it, this is worth a visit. They're open late as well, so its a great spot to meet friends, study, work, do whatever you need to, late into the evening. And Ballantyne is one of the nicest suburbs of Charlotte. Check out Ballantyne's Backyard and the The Bowl at Ballantyne (right across the street) while you're here. There's a whole project called Ballantyne Reimagined that focuses on adding more and more cool stuff to the area.

Sycamore Brewing,checked,Outdoor Outlets,Brewery,Large,South End,"2151 Hawkins St, Charlotte, NC 28203",ChIJoam2YnCfVogRbZHGph05rkM,https://maps.google.com/?cid=4876898246003691885,"https://maps.apple.com/?ll=35.2089475,-80.8620811&q=Sycamore%20Brewing",Yes,Paid,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Bustling taproom & beer garden offering in-house sandwiches & international food-truck fare.,"Gigantic space. I don’t think there’s any other place listed on this website that’s bigger than this one. Two floors. The ground level has a ton of seating, plus even more if you count the connected building’s lobby area, which also has places to sit. There’s an outdoor patio downstairs with plenty of seating, and upstairs there’s another patio that wraps around the building and is just as big. There’s room for you, your whole family, and probably your extended family too.

Access to outlets is marvelous. Splendid. 10/10. If you’re coming to work remotely, you’ll be fine staying charged up. This is one of my favorite places to work from in South End on a weekday morning because it’s so big that you can find a quiet corner and practically have it to yourself until the afternoon crowd starts to roll in. Oh, and if you’re into people watching, this is also a great place for it. There are plenty of seats alongside the Rail Trail where you can sit, sip, and be nosy.

Now, they have all that seating for a reason. Once the South End crowd gets off work, this place fills up fast. It can be overwhelming. The first time I came was a Wednesday evening, which was a mistake for me since I prefer a more laid-back vibe and don’t love crowds or the energy that comes with them. But really, it just depends on when you visit. If you’re feeling social and want that outgoing, energetic atmosphere, come in the evening. If you want something quieter to read, study, work remotely, have a meeting, or catch up with a friend, come on a weekday morning and you’ll get exactly that.

I’m typing this on a Thursday morning here at Sycamore, and it’s me and maybe ten other people in a space that easily fits over a hundred. They’ve got “Yellow” by Coldplay playing in the background, which perfectly fits the calm morning vibe. There’s a coffee bar downstairs with tea and specialty drinks like matcha and chai, and you can order food throughout the day using the QR codes placed around the space.

Most importantly, what impressed me the most is that there are outlets all around the outdoor seating on the upstairs patio. If it’s warm out and you want to sit outside with your laptop and stay charged up, this is a top-tier spot.

The biggest challenge here is parking. The lots right next to the building are paid, but there’s a workaround. If you’re willing to walk a bit, you can park for free at Atherton Mill, which has both outdoor spots and a free garage. It’s less than a five-minute walk. There’s also a lot near Elon University down the street, but that one’s a bit riskier since it’s meant for specific businesses, so there’s a small chance of getting towed. Still, Atherton Mill is so big and has so many businesses that I doubt anyone would care if the place you’re visiting happens to be right around the corner instead of inside the Mill itself.",https://www.sycamorebrew.com/,35.2089475,-80.8620811,"['https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBiGxOaMTE7Sx_Kp_4k6TsDJrAcz3aMVIa-nbA=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxgCDJxZ3xa6iRcdnFRwrj72JtV2ESkSGaiNlZ=w2048-h2048-k-no']",,https://www.tiktok.com/@sycamorebrewing,https://www.instagram.com/sycamorebrewing/,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-KJJ9KdTNnlb9t7b2k-48g,https://www.facebook.com/SycamoreBrewing/,https://x.com/SycamoreBrewing,,12/4/2025 1:01pm,6/6/2024 4:25pm,,11/6/2025 9:33am

There's a seating booth here that's to your right as you walk in that's an excellent spot to plop down. It's back aganist a wall, and when you're seated there's a half wall with a window into the bakery area that blocks your view of the rest of the space. So, most visual distractions are gone. I'm typing this comment from there right now. If you're reading this comment and ever come here, try to snag that spot.

It features rotating Black art, The Ebony Shelf’s curated selection of books by Black and minority authors, and the Ebony Bloom Tea Lounge for tea service, treats, and community events in historic Mint Hill.","This spot is a whole ecosystem of Black culture tucked into a single Mint Hill storefront. Inside, you have The Ebony Shelf, a bookstore where the shelves are heavy on Black and minority authors, the kind of titles that never get the center table at the big chains. There are children’s books, suspense, memoirs, and all sorts of random gems.

Inside that same space you have Ebony Bloom Tea Lounge, a full tea and coffee room in that old school afternoon tea style that's faded but is making a comeback (see The Pauline Tea-Bar Apothecary and A Cause for Tea). They have bistro tables, floral touches, teacups, and various photos of Black cultural icons. The owner is very intentional about this being a welcoming place, especially for the Black community, encouraging you to dress up a bit if you want and make it a spot of your own. Given that I, the creator of this site, am black, I love it!

Then there's the art gallery side, which is basically an open invitation for local artists to take over, hang their work, and host whatever gathering fits the moment. It's one building boasting a bookstore, tea lounge, art gallery, and community room all weaved together and inspired by Black culture.

It's a third place true and through. You can browse a new-to-you Black author, sip tea, and then stick around for an art opening or a themed night.

Parking isn't great, but it isn't terrible as far as South End goes. There's a free lot, but it's shared with other businesses, so at peak times it can get packed. But at least there's a free parking lot. That's a win just in and of itself. Not all Starbucks are created equal.

This is very much a morning third place, the kind of spot where you meet a friend, read a book, catch up on some news, watch a few YouTube videos, think about your life and whether you're making sufficient progress toward the goals you set at the beginning of the year, reflect on the fact that by being in this shop eating a donut you're probably failing at at least one of them, and then walk out sugared up and happy.",https://www.facebook.com/omg.donuts.bakery/,35.3651341,-80.7110355,,,,https://www.instagram.com/omg.donuts.bakery/,,https://www.facebook.com/omg.donuts.bakery/,,,11/29/2025 10:39am,11/16/2025 2:59pm,,11/16/2025 6:45pm

It's a small space, but it still manages to fit a decent amount of seating so you can sit and hang out for a while. The business clearly encourages that since they provide fast and free Wi-Fi. The donuts, coffee, and ice cream are all really good. So if you’re on a diet, don’t come here. Everything is sweet, and everything is good.

They also sell cinnamon rolls, which, as a connoisseur in that field, I’d argue are more accurately described as coffee rolls, but I’ll let it slide. Mostly because on my first visit, a food truck called Cookin & Cruzin was parked outside, selling marvelous breakfast sandwiches and cinnamon rolls from Beyond Amazing Donuts. 

Beyond Amazing has long been on my list of best cinnamon rolls in Charlotte, currently surpassed only by Honeybear Bake Shop and tied for second with Sunflour Bakery. They’re thick, sweet, perfectly glazed, and powerfully pleasing cinnamon rolls. If you haven’t had one, it’s worth the trip to their location, formerly on Park Road and now in Uptown.

I’m not sure if Cookin & Cruzin is always posted up outside this place, but if they are, that’s a good and godly thing. OMG Donuts is a great spot to hang out, especially on a Sunday afternoon. If the food truck is around, you can grab a donut, a coffee, then hangout a bit, grab a breakfast sandwich, and a thick cinnamon roll all in one go.

There's a lot of those on this website. I found myself here out of desperation, the nearby Night Swim closes at 5 PM, and I had a meeting right at that time I needed to be at a laptop for. This was the one of the closest results when I typed in coffee on Google Maps, and it worked quite well.

I would never tell you to go out of your way to come here. It's a cookie cutter Starbucks. But they have good access to outlets, and a decent amount of seating. They have booth style seating with around 8 small tables with outlets near each one. Then 5 or so tables by the window, no outlet access. Then the big table in the middle with outlets underneath it, and some lounge chair style seating. So, marvelous outlet access all around.

On my first (and only) visit here, a family came in and sat in the lounge seating, catching up, chatting, and petting their comically small, but very cute, dog. This place certainly is a third place for them, so it is for me. It's Starbucks, you know what it is. But it works. If you're in this area and want something truly local and nonchain, check out Visart Cafe and Julia's Cafe and Books.

A final note, I don't enjoy Independence Blvd. Having what is essentially a 5-lane highway right next to retail shops with people entering and exiting at wildly different speeds is some sort of masochist masterclass in road design. I came here out of desperation. I will only return under similar circumstances.

There’s some outdoor seating too, so you’ve got more options when it’s warm out.",https://www.somuchmoretothestory.shop/,34.9806346,-80.5505233,"['https://streetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com/v1/thumbnail?panoid=dRLxOAH9Y1-BKdu4druykg&cb_client=maps_sv.tactile.gps&w=1600&h=1000&yaw=261.65857&pitch=0&thumbfov=100', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLQInroChQxPQddhLh_uy3Keia9IJu2gGFbDFw=w2048-h2048-k-no']",,https://www.tiktok.com/@somuchmoretothestory,https://www.instagram.com/somuchmoretothestory/,,https://www.facebook.com/p/So-Much-More-To-The-Story-A-Bookery-61552750779539/,,,11/4/2025 11:50am,11/4/2025 11:23am,,11/6/2025 9:33am
Fly Kid Fly,,,Coffee Shop,Small,Ballantyne,"15119 Bowl St #101, Charlotte, NC 28277",ChIJq4RBQcedVogRS88bznyd_9w,https://maps.google.com/?cid=15924619966764797771,"https://maps.apple.com/?ll=35.0578529,-80.8458031&q=Fly%20Kid%20Fly",Yes,"Free,Time Limited",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Bright and lively coffee shop serving good coffee, tea, & brekky burritos all day! A colorful and playful aesthetic, warm staff, and vibrant atmosphere!","Super small, but it’s in The Bowl at Ballantyne with plenty to do and tons of outdoor seating. If it’s warm, you won’t worry about finding a seat. The inside seating is very unique looking. I'm not good at describing things, but it just doesn't look like a typical coffee shop set up. Very colorful, curves here and there in the design. I like it. The seats aren't comfortable though, just wooden backs, but if you're looking to stay awake and focused, then they're marvelous.

If you can snag a cubicle, you can post up and get some work done, there's even some outlets. The corner ones are my favorite. Feels kind of snug. Definitely bring noise canceling headphones though since it’s small and you can hear everyone within always.

This Charlotte Observer article said to order the Cumulus, described as “an iced matcha with toasted coconut, blue spirulina, and a cloud of cream, agave, and sea salt. If you’re not a coconut fan, skip it, but otherwise, this drink is a little work of art.” 

That sounds spot on for the kind of vibe this place has. I haven't yet gotten into matcha, despite recent rather persuasive attempts to win me over. If you try it, let me know how it is.

Right across the street, also in The Bowl, you have The Salty Donut with more indoor space and cinnamon rolls. Oh, and this place has cinnamon rolls too, orange flavored. So, if you drive down here you can do a whole cinnamon roll run with Fly Kid Fly, The Salty across the street, Sunflour Bakery nearby, and Smallcakes Ballantyne. Bro that’s four places to get cinnamon rolls in a small little area. I love Ballantyne.",http://flykidfly.com/,35.0578529,-80.8458031,"['https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYBJKMStxMJd1nSW1AU-mufiZ4EdcWfpOEo8y4=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBl6wkb88AO1beWI1q4tXbmUb_PawZtoTkFZ6v=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9cWcE8KY4RVb-Z1UFSsuPh5NlXrir8oCm7ePo=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlVv58qaOj5eN7YPMB5aqCLZqem21QceJQ7qgC=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLqbutmtwVM0p4J1IMEfj1PcJuerWfTe9P_mlb=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXFsKWcGbIj6AD23w6C0h5XezFwwSk9tsbWfiE=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQqO_N6d35-wbtA0jwH3NC-ySKNgy6N1ruEbC1=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcXjXxMEtPr6G_7XpRBHckRsUAWMLvro4q1iE3=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaILfEl79sMBY4m3f3IkhzC4rpE8X4Iwrz5Xm4=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbHYvAF-7Po_JXnmVED8e2815jQU0Bjgm9rMDH=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAdKuPdljv4cototxPIKOuBJgiydmOqlnXvSvT=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMoBtch0bK2lvkU97eG1SSdhiU1vMWFhNRgPbM=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiWPHApWb75-mDVkOgLkKKYEYZ_UTCm4zXGA6R=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNa7CjYS4g3KBrOTRJ9dFRI0xl3tm6nzTsBj7-v=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNK7SxQELeTj5QDVAolbRgwgoav5ruBdUoZAyoJ=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOM0Qh_8axtfcp-2yY5NmqaY9pg3PjXRiyL6MZS=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOn8u4cp_-S2O3m5hQbIHuuTE0hD9O8NtAvyrcX=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1iY7t7upkuFKgnbq_Eljd8h6Yk0rmNz1X0KE9=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPv39EPSPIUP9VxYZe_JQ7XeE3qy_tbjYLSfuOp=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvtutUFltwe_uORkEO4jbIjCVEKKxxFhqEu525=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_YaZmXxps7FJbkPUpn6XY_-Y6xBBuIsCGO4wf=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhZYGvZ1_oC2Z13H4BHQX5D7zoE2oVvGQdxQz2=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLXPaeakokulK2HAC9OV6ZzIsui1aWIW9sUA0v=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpaF3xxfuu2qHHMR6tZkVJRJ8YYhOdGQqEMLmx=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMe_YdACkgclVEYJDCwg4uRONP9LU-gT22rTshh=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqXQzeAfuaM8Hxi9JLR9bmArg1GbaNHLBcOpYG=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNE5zPFe8v3LFDhmWszPD4NI0PRxPqNnbxsl_6d=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnbTlquU9NVpj7bVkkbkWVFDsKkuca0G3kSVaC=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONOU4XX2puN4Aebn_3pI1DSE3VkRMY6Qe2jmNT=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4CN8fwdLXypjunMRkf26RN8goeO1auGSFL10j=w2048-h2048-k-no']",,,https://www.instagram.com/flykidfly/,,,,,11/3/2025 3:00pm,11/2/2025 9:55pm,,11/6/2025 9:33am

Founded by two best friends at 18 years old, Provided aims to create an atmosphere of community wherever travelled. As coffee can act as a bridge of connection between others, the customer can expect ""special experiences in unusual places.""","It’s got this grounded, modern vibe with concrete block walls that break up different parts of the space. Olive green and burgundy tones make it feel earthy and warm, and plants here and there tie it all together. It’s not quite industrial chic, it’s industrial something else that I don’t have the vocabulary to describe, but it’s very cool and earthy and I like it.

The lighting is warm, the colors are darker, and the whole place feels like autumn. Even the music fits the mood, with calming indie, dream pop, and a little bit of folk mixed in. There's a projector showing movies, sometimes black and white oldies, and other times whatever people want to see. The effort they put into the aesthetic really shows, and it deserves to be recognized.

I’ve been told their apple butter matcha is really good, but so is the plain matcha. Just straight up matcha powder and hot water. Try it. You'll get the most health benefits that way! It’s already a go-to spot for remote workers, with good outlet access and a decent amount of seating. It feels intentional. Like every part of it was designed for people to stay awhile. 

They have a location in Concord that's equally as awesome. It's attached to a thrift store inside with great finds.

It's well adorned to be inviting and friendly with cushioned chairs here and there, various antiques like hockey tables and gumball machines, and even a kid's coloring section where they put up drawings.

Even the music they choose to play inside is very bubblegum, ice cream truck, happy, light, and sparkly. Feels like ice cream and happiness. Free Wi-Fi, not the best outlet access but there's a spot or two. There's one outdoor seating table. Lots of ice cream options, coffee, hot tea, but most importantly...

They have cinnamon rolls, and they are unique. It's neither cream cheese frosting nor traditional icing that adorns the roll. Instead, it's this caramely drizzle, I can't even say for sure it's caramel, but that's what stands in the place of the more traditional options. And it's light, the flavor isn't overwhelming, but it's not nonexistent. It's there, just existing to accentuate the flavors of the cinnamon roll without stealing the show. The result is a cinnamon roll where you can truly taste and enjoy the cinnamon. 

The icing doesn't overpower it, say for example the way any bottom tier mall variety cinnamon roll does, where they drench it in so much icing that you can't taste anything but gooey bread and sugar. That's not artistry my friends, that's not craftsmanship. Here, they opt for a lighter touch of icing, letting the cinnamon roll as a concept, as a pastry, as a craft, be the main show without distraction.

Not only is it a place where you can drop by for your morning cup of coffee and breakfast, but also where you can enjoy an original, soul food inspired menu with our European Cocktails, unlike you have ever tasted before.","Relaxing wine bar vibes in terms of the aesthetic. Soft lighting, wood tones, touches of greenery (fake plants count) here and there. Lots of Russian inspired desserts that I've never heard of but all sound good, if not interesting. They have something called a chocolate sausage. It's not what you think. I mean, I didn't order it, but I at least asked. It's a sweet treat pastry is all I'll say, no sausage involved.

Good amount of seating, most of it indoors but there's some comfy lounge chair couches outside as well. Decent access to outlets, I counted 5 spots you could sit and access one, not bad at all for a place this size. Free Wi-Fi, and it's plenty fast, so you can plop down here to work or study. There's a very popular Starbucks across the street known for being busy, whereas things are usually pretty calm here. In that sense, it's a hidden gem.

The sink in the men's bathroom is very interesting. I had to look this up, but it's called a ""cantilevered glass vanity"", which to normal people is a ""floating glass sink"". Never seen anything like it, but I mean, I don't come from wealth. Oh, and they also have nice teacups. The handle has this curvature thing to it that wraps into the cup interior, very nice.

Last note, the parking garage has a sign that says 2-hour parking only, but I talked to the staff and apparently that's not enforced at all. You can stay longer and relax. But I mean, if you do get towed, definitely contact me so I can update this comment (and sorry, that's rough buddy).",https://vibecafeandwine.com/charlotte-dilworth-the-vibe-cafe-food-menu,35.201812499999996,-80.8437902,"[""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMESiz2U3Unoyej-i94GHyvp4jFzVcXSwYX8CpQ=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0yjfssdqseYfmDNt9yDRlI7W4zEFt-Uzxerni=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHQVT8W8tx6sGsLD3qLQwSJlIajw_jM1Gk8XmL=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIjKekOcGj9C1JWyRHF9RnzeUMs67Csw2pF8mK=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORvcDanuVS1oSUEUu7iIS1xWNllEwnk43TGfmB=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlmGP3r2IdMTPBgZVwCOeRk27uxyftQ7tDwCn_=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1imlOm3z1LhPElHKK8b3-1f4NGWuGQ4kQm3ZL=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPymzMKP6S2v4Vne5kW66UxTOqNghayPYXR11GX=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUFuXCzZ_UJNIiGjIdUfqMXAz-9ypXNlSb72-t=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfkwM4Lcej6krur5Hr4ic0dk5WS0lOA4sqLLeZ=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhvUpjoh4WvKmezUTdF6R9KGR7XGWHS72mb0Q4=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObBUmmPDtzxO4qU5sggBTdmHWclEzCCljgpGvk=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOm8AW5l0PRy9ngN4rNwiJh3AorTKokZHR26AKV=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBLU11miNpToAQLR5wWf7zESGi7NoQxElSxpEh=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRHzWboFTCh8bsxP4xj9o86o0Rky_nObNM-CBA=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgPD5DKVgh0Y1_Rx5kxd5gJpgMLfyUOCrBnIaR=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO36w1TIUeNqum0zefxPMNHG6nj-8ptXZAaESMB=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvu5vUiXOFhHZ7WkVEacf8P5MsxqFenvEna0eO=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8oxpSNGEBdyKLMeN0TN5t0iyVaWeS3-hqt2-w=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOKGK04phAp7ibg9pHSAIjWJYcu7FzjlRykS07=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIT9Ry7H6I2x9CQsLYu5WcdHPyxX4x_OK4q2J8=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5I9Vr-s7Q-v3EH-XSAAGMLGHQFYoLBt_oo22u=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMozVMZ3bc6pzdEcSo8Q_3B3lSbNJ-qWxq6AgiR=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7RmI3wEcGHkyDrWYk7awGRxSwIQELtbRiHgZU=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9HbY2taKCF7pLKSMQXwPauYNGvcJUy9PQkEbV=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNodQziWmq7pp1__JNnJ4XuiGzhFnMsTlMuB1Qp=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5q3ssCHjuDF7HniAPOTnJ-pgw5wgoCU-Rdau_=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkQ02GlUXGXFGaKCoHrGOGGo55TVl7F7Evjsg8=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiC9d3brft6-6ScOIoIl0B6m5WWm5HOxH9TycS=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZHnmdBLxeXKW-p5Cf5F-cHLd2TfCaVtDWyU18=w2048-h2048-k-no""]",,,https://www.instagram.com/vibe.cafebar/,,https://www.facebook.com/people/Vibe-Cafe-and-Bar/61570075900106/,,,11/3/2025 2:00pm,10/16/2025 2:47pm,,11/6/2025 9:33am

We also serve espresso, drip coffee, iced chai, and naturally sugared soda.","I came here for cinnamon rolls not expecting it to also be a third place. So, I was pleasantly surprised walking in to see people sitting all around with their friends and loved ones, chatting, eating pastries, drinking coffee, and enjoying life. It’s in a converted house that’s pretty small, but they manage to have enough seating that Waxhaw families seem to regularly come here to hangout. So much so that they have coloring books for kids.

It’s a bakery known for its bread. Sourdough, focaccia, brioche, croissants, and more. But idgaf about all that, I came for their cinnamon rolls. At first glance, you might mistake it for a coffee roll, which is a doughnut, not a cinnamon roll. But upon closer inspection, there’s no doubt that what they serve here is a proper cinnamon roll. 

They opt for icing instead of cream cheese frosting, which means its best enjoyed warm (you can have a room temp cinnamon roll with cream cheese frosting, and it’ll taste fine, but icing demands warmth to shine). Once you warm this, it’s solid. Not transcendent, but solid. I still have Honeybear Bake Shop as my top spot in the region, with Sunflour Bakery and Beyond Amazing Doughnuts right behind them. That said, there’s so many third places in Waxhaw with cinnamon rolls that the whole city is worth a day trip. Just check the map (shout out the greatest map of all time).

Anyways, they also serve coffee and tea and have Wi-Fi, so if you can snag a spot, it’s not a bad place to study, work, or read. Just bring noise canceling headphones because it’s small to the point of being able to hear everyone in the house at all times.",http://www.virtuosobreadworks.com/,34.9238061,-80.7391758,,,https://www.tiktok.com/@virtuosobread,https://www.instagram.com/virtuosobread/,,https://www.facebook.com/virtuosobread/,,,10/11/2025 6:31pm,10/11/2025 10:23am,,11/6/2025 9:33am

The interior is small in terms of seating, but not compact. It doesn't feel cramped, and there are some larger tables where groups can sit. On warm days, there's a good amount of outdoor seating, so you can be reasonably sure you'll find somewhere to sit coming here. Outlet access is challenging, so charge your laptop if you're coming to work or study. 

Kind of a pricey menu, but that’s just the world these days. Blame inflation. Parking is free if you can snag a street spot and have the confidence to parallel park. If not, there’s a shared lot for all the businesses at The Bowl that gives you a few free hours. After that, you’ve got to pay.

Now, onto a topic of the utmost importance. They’ve got what is officially called a Honey Butter Cinnabun on their menu. Close enough. I’m counting it as a cinnamon roll. And it’s good, really good. Still, it leans more toward a donut than a traditional cinnamon roll. You don’t get that heavy, weighty interior with distinct coils that you could unravel. There's not that clear picture of something having been rolled up to create its present form.

You couldn’t pull this apart from spiral to straight. It’s all baked together like a soft bread roll. But it’s still delicious.

Otherwise, there’s a small sticky note near the checkout counter with it. Ask the staff if you can’t find it, although as an introvert myself, there’s a mild amount of social anxiety I get when asking for the Wi-Fi password only for the barista to point to a big obvious sign I somehow missed. So, yeah.

The layout here is pretty neat. There’s stadium-style seating with pillows, some lounge chairs, and a few tables with chairs both upstairs and downstairs. The main challenge is the truly abysmal access to outlets. If you’re planning to work here, charge your laptop ahead of time. Other than that, I like the vibes. The pastries are solid. Honestly, better than Amelie’s in my opinion.

Also, when Tous les Jours first came to Charlotte, I was like “wow, what a cool spot.” Then a friend from New York was like “lol, y’all really think this is special?” and I was embarrassed (NYC transplants in Charlotte please just go home if nothing here pleases or impresses you, stop bullying the rest of us for being simple and happy).

If you've never heard of that park, that's okay neither had I. I had to use AI reverse image search to find the name. it often seems like nobody in Charlotte is from Charlotte, we're all transplants in this wonderful city.

But let me not be presumptuous. If you had heard of Marshall Park, go ahead and pat yourself on the back, and maybe consider making your way over here for a visit. They've got bubble tea (cold options only), food, a few pastries (no cinnamon rolls tho), and a decent amount of seating.

Not sure what it is, but it’s a sweet and light aroma. Maybe it was just the day I went, idk. Smelled really good though. The place is small, but they managed to fit two stuffed animal vending machine claw game things. 

It has a very muted, minimalist aesthetic. Clean and uniform. Grays, whites, gold accents. It’s right next to a Wing Stop and Olive Garden, so if you’re hungry, get a drink here, get your food nearby. 

There’s Wi-Fi and 2 spots you can sit and reach an outlet, so you could come here to work or study. I wouldn’t though, seems like it’d be hard to focus. The entire store is always in view no matter where you sit.

Instead, it feels both clean and inviting, but also lived in. The upstairs loft is honestly one of my favorite places in Charlotte to read a book. There isn’t a ton of seating, but if you snag a spot, you can nestle in for hours, put your cares aside, and just enjoy some literature. Every so often, you can glance up at the huge art piece on the wall for something to look at.

Downstairs is the bookstore itself. It’s not huge and the selection isn’t on a Barnes & Noble level, but it feels authentic. The books really come from the community. Kids donate their grandma’s collections, students finishing school pay it forward, people leave their favorite titles because they have extra copies, and so on. The collection here feels more heartfelt than at other bookstores in the city.

They have coffee, tea, snacks, grab and go food, a few pastries and cookies, and most importantly, good vibes. There is usually a great early 2000s easy listening playlist. Think The Script, Kodaline, John Mayer, The Fray, Kelly Clarkson, Plain White T’s, Snow Patrol, Five for Fighting. All good stuff.

As a bonus, the shop connects internally to a Habitat for Humanity store, so you can do a little shopping after reading.

It's so bright, pure-looking, and impeccably clean that it goes beyond the typical modern coffee shop aesthetic. It's as if someone deliberately designed it to resemble a café in heaven, or at least how heaven is often portrayed in movies and TV. The atmosphere is calming, and the space is airy, it doesn't feel like everyone is on top of each other. 

Outlet access is fantastic. I'm pretty sure you can charge your device from almost every single seat inside. But here's what really won me over. The men's restroom has complimentary mouthwash, Q-tips, band-aids, lotion, a lint roller, and body spray.

Just inside Calvary's main entrance Atrium, you'll find the café—a warm and welcoming space filled with natural light. Perfect for meeting friends and enjoying conversation and community.","This place is a great excuse to visit Calvary Church, even if you're not religious, simply because of how beautiful it is. The external architecture alone is worth the trip. From the outside, it’s stunning. And on the inside, it’s massive, pristine, and modern in ways that surprised me. Calvary is known for being more traditional, the suit and tie kind of church, but the space feels fresh.

The coffee shop is tucked in a corner near the entrance. On its own, with both indoor and outdoor seating, it’s pretty spacious. And if it gets full, there’s plenty of extra lounge-style seating in the lobby that feels fair game for coffee shop patrons. There’s also a Christian bookstore and reading area called the Word Room that’s just as large as the shop itself.

As for the coffee, I’m not a coffee drinker, so I won’t pretend to be an expert, but it didn't appear to be anything remarkable. The tea options are pretty standard too, just your usual bagged selections. But the real draw here is the atmosphere. The peace and quiet, the beauty of the church, the solid access to outlets, the little umbrella-covered tables outside, and the chance to walk around the campus without needing to attend a service.

I'm a Christian, but non-denominational, so I probably wouldn’t have ended up at Calvary otherwise. I’m glad I came to see the coffee shop and explore the area.

The interior design is very well done. Earthy, muted tones, a sort of modern minimalism, lots of natural light from floor to ceiling windows, a thoughtful orange-red accent wall bearing their logo, mid-century modern wooden chairs paired with cushioned benches.

Haraz is rumored to be opening some new locations, and a spot called Bayt Al-Mocha is on its way to town sometime soon. They're all wonderful, although I still give Vavela the award for most beautiful coffee shop in Charlotte. I’d say this spot is most similar to Qahwah House in terms of size, and it shares the same beautiful, polished, upscale aesthetic that all the Middle Eastern coffee shops seem to have. The floors here literally glisten. 

One thing that stands out is the booth-style seating, with soft patterned fabric and pillows that make it easy to stay awhile and study, read, or work remotely. The cheesecake options are crazy in the best way possible. They don’t have cinnamon rolls, but they do sometimes have a cinnamon roll cheesecake, a revolutionary combination of pastry proportions I'd never imagined possible.

If you like any of the other Middle Eastern coffee spots, you should make your way here. It’s worth the drive no matter what side of town you’re on. Outlet access is solid if you grab a spot by the wall. Most of the seating is round tables in the center, so come with a full charge just in case.

As a family-owned coffee shop, we cordially invite you to stop by and treat yourself to some freshly-brewed coffee, healthy chai tea, thirst-quenching lemonade, or palate-pleasing frappuccino.","Let me start by confessing my bias. I’m a devout Christian, so naturally I’m partial to this place. I love the Psalms and often turn to them as a way to enter into prayer. So when I walked in and saw the name, the concept, and the unapologetically Christian theme, I couldn’t help but love the place. 

There are Bible verses throughout the shop, a warm and inviting decor, and a wooden cross where you can leave a prayer or note on a post-it. I saw open Bibles on tables and overheard conversations about faith. Everything about this place resonated with me. To be clear though, it’s open to everyone. The owners just aren’t shy about their faith, which is exactly how it should be in a country founded in part on religious freedom.

It’s small, and especially popular on weekends, but for good reason. It’s new as of 2025 and already has a steady group of regulars. It’s miraculous I’ve talked this much and haven’t yet mentioned the fact that they have cinnamon rolls 🙌🏾🔥. Well sized, generously iced, filled with cinnamon goodness. They also have other pastries and cold drinks, along with a full coffee menu and a few tea options.

If you have kids, there’s a fenced-in play area right out front so you can sip coffee while your little ones run around without worry. It’s a thoughtfully designed coffee shop, unambiguous in its Christian mission and commitment to charity, kindness, and making all feel welcome. I love it.",https://psalmscoffeepressley.com/,35.103578899999995,-80.63135,"['https://streetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com/v1/thumbnail?panoid=fn09Iy2Knhl6q8vqk20IWQ&cb_client=maps_sv.tactile.gps&w=1600&h=1000&yaw=120.908676&pitch=0&thumbfov=100', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyvpN2wkDFHlW8Dp2i3pPWBZp26f1fhPdXxuDV=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3c_TYOCtLJgNv5QZmBRAWuxLXEBuxw9ZN-HU_=w2048-h2048-k-no']",,,https://www.instagram.com/psalmscoffee_co/,,https://www.facebook.com/p/Psalms-Coffee-61575305990290/,,,9/8/2025 12:20pm,8/13/2025 9:15am,,11/6/2025 9:33am

Lots of great vegan sandwiches and health-conscious choices. They have a full menu with non-vegan options too, but it's all good. The Hangover breakfast sandwich is spectacular. It's a real meal, properly sized, worth the price, and will actually fill you up.

The aesthetic is very much deli. Not a ton of seating, most of it is bar-style, but there’s pretty decent access to outlets throughout.

The vibes are good as well. Bright aesthetic, wood colored tables and chairs with green accents here and there by way of plants. Very popular spot for friend groups to meet up. Also a hot spot among remote workers. And dates, always seems to be some love birds in here on weekends.

Outlet access is good, not great though, so I’d suggest coming charged up.

This place is the opposite of that. It’s the real deal. It's tucked inside a laundromat but has its own entrance and corner. It’s small but welcoming, with bright colors that reflect the Colombian heritage of the owners. There’s some outdoor seating if it gets crowded, though I haven’t seen that be a problem.

We have a beautifully designed 1920’s Mercantile-themed monochromatic throwback, where people feel excited by their surroundings, and blown away by their treats. Great for business meetings, families, couples, and you!","Beautifully designed interior. Really beautiful art piece to your right on the wall as you walk in. Inviting atmosphere, there’s a seating area with a half wall that I love. Makes you feel nestled in, great for remote work or studying. They have excellent herbal tea options that they steep properly (no bags, loose leaf👏🏾), coffee, and all sorts of sweet treats, including ice cream and pastries.

But the topic of the utmost importance here is their cinnamon rolls. They’re a creamery in addition to a coffee shop, and some of that skill with sweetness has made its way to their cinnamon rolls. The icing (not cream cheese, which is good but harder to get right) is caked on top, in a way that provides enjoyment cold as well as warm. It’s not terribly large, not terribly wide, not terribly tall, not terribly small. It’s just right. Bravo.

If you’re looking for coffee or ice cream commentary, check the Google Maps reviews. People love both here, while I stick to herbal teas and cinnamon rolls. A man can only have so many vices.

Cool quirky aesthetic blended with upscale industrial chic vibes. Artwork from local musicians on the walls, Indie/alternative playlist, mismatching chair and pillow colors. It’s well designed for sure.

I’m sure the coffee is great, but I’m a tea guy, so I love that they properly steep their herbal teas here. Instead of the typical coffee shop routine of rushing hot water over a bag and calling it a day, this place opts for true tea tradition, steeping the leaves at the right temperature based on their type. 

White teas are best steeped around 160°F to 180°F for 2 to 4 minutes. Green teas shine at 175°F to 185°F for 1 to 3 minutes. Black teas need a hotter brew, closer to 200°F to 212°F for 3 to 5 minutes. They understand that here. Bravo to them.

It feels lived in and well loved, all adding up to a marvelously inviting place that I cannot recommend enough. It took me a few years of living in Charlotte and hearing people mention it before I finally made my way here, and I’m so glad I did.

This is top tier, 100 out of 10, for remote workers or students who feel stressed and need a spot where they can open a laptop, get some work done, then step away and relax. The McGill Rose Garden here provides just that. It's much larger than it looks from the road and gives you a forest-like, nature-filled oasis in the middle of one of Charlotte’s busiest neighborhoods.

The garden is the draw here. Don’t come just to sit inside. Bring a book, bring a friend, bring your dog. Show up early to beat the heat, or if it's not that hot, show up whenever. There is plenty of space to spread out and find your own quiet little corner.

It’s also a top tier date spot. The garden is large enough that, outside of peak weekend hours, you're likely to find a tucked-away space to sit together and have an intimate conversation. I went on a weekday morning and have never felt more at ease anywhere in Charlotte while working remotely. 

Indoor seating is limited, but if you show up early, you can usually get a spot. And every now and then, stand up, stretch your legs, and walk the garden paths.

Private & corporate catering options. We also boast a beautiful event space at the shop for corporate dinners, gatherings, baby showers, wedding rehearsal dinners, birthdays, and more.","I'll start with what's most important. They have cinnamon rolls, and they are gargantuan. Colossal. Titanic, even. Not in height, but in circumference. I have never seen a cinnamon roll like it. Generously covered in cream cheese frosting and perfectly round. So very round. So very rotund. They’re made in house. They also make a variety of other sweet treats and serve food, coffee, and tea. 

As a place to hang out, work remotely, study, or meet up with friends, it’s top tier. Outlet access is solid in a corner with taller chairs, but what I like most is that the primary seating area has a wall that separates it from the rest of the store. There’s got to be some interior design principle that the TikTok feng shui guy would be able to name about why this works so well. It makes you feel cozy and comfortable, and it eliminates visual distractions. There could be 20 people in line and while you might hear them, you won’t see them, which really helps you feel nestled in.

The interior has a very cute, feminine aesthetic with bright colors and pink highlights here and there. They also have a cool-looking wine section and a larger table for groups.

I usually park at Atherton Mill (it's free) and bounce between this spot and Not Just Coffee. If one is crowded, I walk to the other, no need to move the car. It is a prime remote-work setup.

They make excellent use of what is a pretty large space for a coffee shop. Most of the seating is against a wall, so you’ve got something solid on one side to anchor you. There’s probably some kind of psychology behind how sitting with a wall nearby makes you feel safer, cozier, more nestled in. It’s newer and spotless as a result. Immaculate, really.

It’s inside Myers Park United Methodist Church, but it’s its own thing. Manolo’s is a Latin bakery in Charlotte, and this is their expansion into the coffee shop world. It’s their space, but it's clearly faith friendly and loved by the church.

Top tier spot to get some work done. They close in the early afternoon though, so plan accordingly. Seating is placed smartly with good access to outlets. There's artwork everywhere, and you’ll find outlets in most corners if you look. There’s also a long table down a hallway for group work and even a bookable conference room. Fast and free Wi-Fi. Gelato, pastries, coffee, and what makes me happiest, loose leaf herbal teas. Not bagged. Properly steeped. The Cherry Green is my favorite.

Parking can get tight during peak hours since it shares space with the church, but there’s overflow parking across the street.

They're everywhere, and every single one is real. I went in the morning once to work, and a gardener came through to water them all.

Babaloo Coffee Club is your go-to destination for a delightful sensory journey that celebrates the art of coffee","I nearly introduced a ""Tiny"" sizing to this website after visiting this spot. It's beyond small, it's micro. There are quite literally two tables, totaling four seats, inside, with a handful more outside. If you're a morning person, this is a marvelous spot to bring a book, grab a coffee, and have your pick of the place before it gets busy. It feels closer to a grab-and-go stall than a place to hang out a while, but there is seating, it's just limited.

If you're waiting for me to comment about the quality of the coffee, I'm sorry. I'm not a coffee person. This website has just about every coffee shop in greater Charlotte and yet its creator does not drink coffee. I'm an herbal tea guy. Hot, specifically.

Inspired by Venezuelan, North American, and Buenos Aires roots, the menu offers globally inspired treats with familiar, comforting flavors.","Small spot, maybe not ideal for an extended stay, but perfect for grabbing a bite or meeting a friend for a chat. There’s outdoor seating so on warm days finding a seat isn’t hard. There’s also Wi-Fi so you’re welcome to hangout a while if you want. Just be warned, inside it’s all high chairs, so not much back support.

But let’s talk about what’s most important at a bakery, the pastries. They're known for their croissants so definitely get one if you go. Then we have the focaccia or croissant breakfast sandwich, expensive ($11 when last I went), but good. All of that though is secondary to their cinnamon rolls. They call them coffee rolls, but I protest that label. Let’s dissect.

A coffee roll is basically a yeast doughnut ring that is fried, coated in a sugar glaze, and rarely holds much cinnamon. A true cinnamon roll is baked, shaped into a spiral with cinnamon-sugar folded between the layers, and usually finished with a cream cheese or vanilla icing. Completely different textures and flavor profile.

They’re similar enough that most people call them the same thing, but they’re different. What Vicente sells are cinnamon rolls. Both the icing and the cinnamon sugar are flavored with a hint of coffee (hit or miss on if you'll like this, I didn't), hence their decision to call it a coffee roll, but it's a cinnamon roll. Trust me on this, cinnamon rolls are my specialty. 

Finally, the staff here is very kind. A coworker of mine got into an accident right in front of the store, and they came out to check on them, made sure they were okay, and gave them a free box of pastries.

Our stunning industrial space features soaring 20-foot columns, floor-to-ceiling windows, and multiple seating areas perfect for working, meeting, or relaxing. Enjoy locally-made pastries in our quiet, welcoming atmosphere. Free parking available in garage. Come see why we're Rock Hill's must-visit coffee destination!","A fully automated coffee shop. No baristas, just robots making the drinks. My first reaction? That sounds soulless, heartless, anti-human. Like it's putting baristas out of work and killing one of the main reasons people go to coffee shops in the first place. The vibes, the human interaction, the sense of community that makes a third place feel alive. But the owners kept all the right things. Cozy interior design, a good amount of seating, and little nooks and corners to settle into. They just automated the barista and ordering part. It's still a warm, comfortable place to hang out. It's just that the drinks aren't ""made with love"" so much as they're ""made with precision.""

The shop sits inside the Rock Hill Event Center, which has a restaurant and all sorts of things going on, including the American Cornhole League Headquarters. Walk around the entire building if you visit. There's a very cool history of Rock Hill on display, including a model train set telling the story of the building before it became an event space. The whole thing makes for a great day trip from Charlotte.

The café itself isn't super huge, but every corner has seating and there's good access to outlets. It is a great spot for working remotely. There's a cute, artsy corner with half walls that's perfect for focusing. No hot tea from the machine, which is my thing, but all the coffee options are there. Pastries from local bakers (Wild Flour Sweets and The Daily Dough), snacks, and even store merch are available from vending machines.

I'm not a coffee person, so I can't speak to the quality of the brews, but everyone there seemed satisfied. Empire Pizza, right across from the building, is said to be pretty good too.

We want to be more than just another coffee shop.","Waterbean Pineville has been my favorite of all their locations ever since it replaced Unwind Tea and Coffee. But this spot is giving it some real competition. The interior follows the Waterbean style guide: bright, clean, and energetic. White walls and faux marble tables. A mix of black and green velvet chairs with gold legs.

It feels like the café you'd find in the lobby of a tech or tech adjacent company, a look that matches the overall Waterbean aesthetic, as seen at their South End location at the base of LendingTree headquarters. Elegant yet approachable and perfect for getting work done. Outlet coverage is decent. The coffee bar has some tucked underneath for extra convenience.

The real standout is the rooftop patio. It seats around twenty, is strung with lights, has shaded corners, and plenty of open sky. If it's not too hot, it's a great place to post up and read, study, or chill. Many coffee shops have patios, few have rooftop ones!

Food/drink wise, I maintain that the Waterbean Special sandwich is one of the best in town. But their respect for tea remains why I love their locations. A magnetic display of tins lets you sample nearly twenty herbal blends by scent before you order. Temple of Heaven, Honeymilk Ginger, and Sweet Green Oolong are my favorites. 

As someone who runs a site cataloguing almost every coffee shop in Charlotte, it may surprise you to learn that I don't drink coffee. I'm a tea guy, and as such, respect any place that treats it with this much care.

It looks like it might be the gas station's interior until you look up and see their sign. Parking is limited right in front of the store, and you can't park in the gas station spots, but there's more options behind the building and in the general area, all free.

Aside from that, if you've been to any Waterbean location, it shares that same polished white aesthetic, with darker accent colors on the chairs and decorations scattered about. Sort of like a modern doctor's office sort of thing going on. Or a cool and hip online bank that doesn't have brick and mortar stores and is trying to make finance cool, like Ally I guess. I mean all of that in a good way, I like the aesthetic here. 

What I like most though is the marvelous menu of loose leaf herbal teas they offer. Well over 20 options, green, white, oolong, herbal,, black, all sorts of custom blends. The Temple of Heaven herbal tea remains one of my favorites here.

It's a solid spot to plop down and study/work. I see student study groups here all the time. It's a small space but they pack it full of seating, and there's decent outlet to access if you sit in one of the 4-5 spots along the main wall.

The Turkish food here is amazing. Specifically the Turkish pizza options are 🔥. Their bathrooms have mirrors with built-in lighting you can control with touch-sensitive buttons. Very cool. As for the name, Anatolia refers to the ancient region that makes up most of modern-day Turkey, a crossroads of civilizations, so it’s fitting that the space feels both timeless and stylish.",http://www.anatoliacafeandcuisine.com/,35.317699999999995,-80.77188,"['https://streetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com/v1/thumbnail?panoid=VUuCQezm4REayrO25G5QLg&cb_client=maps_sv.tactile.gps&w=1600&h=1000&yaw=334.542&pitch=0&thumbfov=100', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrT5ifriUqwhCh4iY1L6k-9oSS7RKuJwqayYog=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIEOMchymU5qGm_hdm5a1TFM_kMZyxZMkV2sM5=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPZ-nt0kvoRqJOwhEH6wqzrwF_xjBF-d6WjpXm=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTmlI9SVvGb04SDpgo2syQ8x6qeGvG6gEFJ_wL=w2048-h2048-k-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMawdRrSgevKMj1NgiqAW4WTEWa68dwcoxldKqv=w2048-h2048-k-no']",,https://www.tiktok.com/@anatoliacafeandcuisine,https://www.instagram.com/anatoliacafeandcuisine/,,https://www.facebook.com/people/Anatolia-Cafe-Cuisine/61569773084608/,,,9/8/2025 12:20pm,6/16/2025 8:57pm,,11/6/2025 9:33am

Matcha is a whole trend now, but traditionally, it’s just tea. Finely ground green tea powder whisked with hot water. Not sweet, not dressed up, just straight-up tea with enormous health benefits. I appreciate that this spot still lets you order it that way, even if you get a weird look for actually liking it.

There's a good amount of seating inside, with more outside.

If you're going here to study or work, go early. It gets pretty busy nearly every day of the week. That's likely because it's a bakery, so the earlier you go, the fresher the items. On weekends, it's packed. Families galore, line out the door.

The Wi-Fi is fast and free; there's a sign to the left of the checkout counter with the password. There are around 3-4 spots you can sit with outlet access, so not great, but not terrible. They have hot tea as well as other standard coffee shop drinks. The pastries are all fine.

The sandwiches are great, especially the Vinny, and of course their main draw, the cannoli, lives up to the hype. What I appreciate most, though, is that they sell cinnamon rolls. They look and taste suspiciously like the Pillsbury ones from the grocery store, but honestly, no shame in that. They'll do.

They’ve also got a few hook and ring toss games on the tables. If you’ve never played, they’re surprisingly addictive. You think it should be simple, but after missing over and over, pride kicks in. Before you know it, you’ve lost half an hour trying to land that one perfect toss.

Anyways, this is a very nice spot, right in the heart of downtown Waxhaw. Within walking distance, you’ve got Jebena Cafe, Crossroads Coffee, and Provisions Waxhaw.

They have cinnamon rolls (💯🔥), and let you order them without icing, which is unique and a plus for those looking to indulge but skip a few calories.

There’s a little seating section downstairs with a very cool jazz-inspired wall art piece, and a bit more space upstairs and out on the patio. 

It’s compact, as houses tend to be, but the vibe is welcoming. They’ve also got a gift shop and pastries. No cinnamon rolls, but the red velvet pound cake is 🔥.

Wooden floors, tables, and chairs give it character in a way that feels intentional and comfortable, not outdated. 

It’s in the heart of downtown Waxhaw, right on the main walkway, so if you’re into people-watching, this is a great spot to post up with a coffee and watch the town stroll by.

But let me turn my focus to something of the utmost importance. They have cinnamon rolls, and they are divine. Cream cheese frosting that looks like the disheveled hair of a British rock star, chaotic and glorious in the best way. The roll is puff pastry-style, generously sized, and loaded with cinnamon. 

Overall, I like this place because it feels authentic and lived-in. They also have a general store and a full food menu, along with solid coffee, tea, and pastries. If you like small-town, locally-owned, down-to-earth, authentic vibes, a day trip to Waxhaw is worth it.

Plenty of seating, they have an upstairs area and a lot of outdoor space in addition to the main floor. Davidson is a college town so plenty of students and staff hangout here to study and work.

The aesthetic is down-to-earth, lived in, like a place that's been around for a while. I mean that in a good way, it doesn't have that pristine modern coffee shop vibe that's nice but a little plastic, it feels very homey. I think this might be the original Summit location, so that's why.

They have this birthday cake looking cookie where they put the frosting in the middle and don't spread it around. It's almost like they want you to eat your way to the frosting. It's a good cookie. Also they have a cinnamon roll that they call a ""Big Bun"". It's light on icing, but it is a cinnamon roll at it's core, so it counts.

As first-generation immigrants, we celebrate coffee’s power to bring people together through tradition and hospitality. Ask a team member for a validation code for up to 4 hours of free garage parking.","Just as beautiful as the original Charlotte location in Elizabeth, but I give this one a leg up because it's bigger. There's plenty of seating. They've nailed this ""modern but not cookie cutter"" aesthetic that reflects the Yemeni culture behind the business. The coffee is good. I don’t even drink coffee, but I usually get something when I come here. The red tea is great too.

There’s free street parking, but it's all parallel and pretty limited. Official parking is in the garage owned by the South & Hollis apartment complex. The rates are ridiculous, and they don’t use ParkMobile, they’ve got their own thing. Haraz will validate, but personally, I’d rather park down the street than give some random parking company all my info. But that’s just me, data privacy nerd over here.

In can get packed here during peak times. There's apartments all around and the residents love this place. But if you're a remote worker, this is a chill spot on most weekdays. If you show up in the morning it's usually not that busy and you'll have plenty of seating spots to choose from. Outlet access is solid. The best seating to me is the light brown booth style seats in a corner near the wall with the Yemeni artwork. There's outlets underneath all the seats, padded backs, and a half wall thing with plants on top that block your view of the rest of the shop if you sit on a certain side. Makes you feel nestled in. 

This neighborhood, LoSo, has a lot going on now in terms of places to check out. Thousand Hills Coffee and The Everyday Market are right across the street, both great third places. And there’s a ton of other spots within walking distance. Plus, it's right on the train line, so if you live in South End, you don’t even have to drive to get here.",https://harazcoffeehouse.com/,35.1933119,-80.87292579999999,['https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMqz2xrrG6UcVJcNnZaNUsqmcysdu3ScOqszTB=w2048-h2048-k-no'],"IMG_5321.JPG (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/48/48/1765022400000/i4bFnzsGromeWMuOp3ilaA/Ipzf60d0A-PFXXV4iGEb_LhIa7z7_x_Waj1m3XlvkxhZIKApDTx7Olnaad87CarChqNnSpaTKmboio2wngvVMMQsCbfuxMp5Le-x3WJQiiFT6TrHlqgSHaztmm4Ay5vkVCSeTRo-6G-aO4img1R6DRQRffn0Y8qKhC6Jv5hNkqM/-BGH1kXPp67ZXpJCwhisbXfrAmSlW5UZrTj9GiLSGbg),IMG_5323.JPG (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/48/48/1765022400000/aCSMGMDEuIWYh9v1iUcvYw/UIuzWOzoMVZ3F-MerdtDgK-Hfb0C7vZnE3yL6lxUbKK08-WghR8_XH4WAHpz8PGt7dpMRgJEq36OMM0kU-dXVWJ70GunYy5nV7SUFrnTHTcWJdFQxf5U9YSAKOUC6zHDBo8AvevXL6HyoRNiryqXkfWa3WEzV8sHofkT5dBLWy0/tWlDASssXiKt9A9wzEpGSmVOqYhM6jq4ow3BDLUWtSw),IMG_5324.JPG (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/48/48/1765022400000/33LMpEFZWQtbwARabZhqbA/-ECx3Ar34XZXO2EokgpTFETrZj1CpIPjVT8btAIj-rWw6IPuOTNf9kG9GuO6XsHmApqW3AO4Uk3PGojf9TpXKHuj5MxS12D5dnDlcfqdIWqHmGYzr9L2_pPVDPOQyljq3-JNGfE9fcAPquMyFmw3QWQNp_QV9WXWSWHicXnn-j4/o8DHqTIF32HU8XViWxwPHs9UpGG3BgqyUZmJzvoBMdE),IMG_5326.JPG (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/48/48/1765022400000/XGcipHy5Iso9sUESl_KsBA/Bt-Q673AQOgcC_XGqL6AVTdA49Oi9G3M2Whfs5fv_QeZt8WhL71PIy2g9xmXVbO1rL2QolLkY_3zRBbeme7ADSotiuosxH-aD0xnM9T2XgGkPcGNhQEqxysrhg3YAFw11UiWAx4dz8eZ-AWBt-KVblYv_Qqjcbbe5sWBHD6GV6Q/9wF0rUIlNBK5bbbYh9jOgj0rT_7x81OGwfBKGtfdQ54)",,https://www.instagram.com/harazcoffeehouse/,,https://www.facebook.com/p/Haraz-Coffee-House-100063988245080,https://x.com/harazcoffeeusa,,11/14/2025 10:15am,5/29/2025 9:46am,,11/6/2025 9:33am

This unique destination seamlessly blends the love of books with the warmth of a coffeeshop, making it a tranquil space for people to come together. Whether you're working, meeting a friend, walking our nature trail, or reading, we have a spot for you to enjoy! Each purchase contributes to supporting worthy global and local missions and Meck ministries, making every visit a meaningful act of kindness that makes a profound difference.","The space is huge, with a ground-floor bookstore, an upstairs loft with even more seating, and a sizeable outdoor patio that's great for reading with a view. If you’re looking for a place to work or study and want a guaranteed seat, this is the spot. 

It’s inside a church, but the entrance to the café is clearly marked and tucked off to the side, so you won’t accidentally wander into a service. And to take things over the top, they even have a walking trail called the ""Meck Trail."" Ask the staff where the entrance is. It’s thoughtfully designed with Bible verse signs placed along the path. Most of the trail is lined with trees and covered in gravel, so you get that peaceful outdoors vibe without dealing with mud. Since it’s a church bookstore, most of the books are Christian, which I love as a Christian myself. 

The café sells Honeybear Bake Shop pastries, who boast some of the best cinnamon rolls in Charlotte. They also have a solid tea selection, good coffee, and a friendly staff that’s always ready to help. Outlet access is decent. Downstairs is limited, but upstairs there are desks and tables with power strips nearby. Seating is a mix of leather chairs with metal frames, modern café-style chairs, and plenty of four-top tables.

Black walls and furniture with gold, white, and gray accents throughout. It’s clearly designed to feel fancy, and the pricing reflects that. This place is unapologetically gourmet. There’s a coffee shop, pastries (including cinnamon rolls 🙏🏾🔥), bar, and market items. They have individually sold chilled Capri Suns, and I respect that. So it’s not entirely pretentious despite being upscale. 

There’s an upstairs area behind the bar, and that’s where most of the indoor seating is. It’s pretty cozy up there, mostly four-top tables and a few armchairs. The lighting is dim in a way that makes it feel calm and private, great spot to read a book or have a quiet meal away from a crowd. Downstairs, in addition to bar seating, there’s an outdoor patio with nice chairs. 

Parking is free on weekends, but since they share the garage with other businesses, you might have to pay depending on the day and time. Overall, a very fancy-feeling spot.

Enjoy pastries in a cozy space built for community and connection. Visit the best coffee shop in town today!","This spot has a great atmosphere for getting work done. It's cozy, but not in that countryside cabin, fall-asleep-with-a-book kind of way. It's more like, this chair is comfortable, the natural lighting (tall windows) is great, and I've got my own little corner to focus and be productive. Cozy with a buzz, not cozy with a nap.

Outlet access is solid if you sit at the coffee bar, and while it's a little more limited by the smaller two-person tables, there are enough spots where your charger can reach. So outlet access really isn't an issue here at all. The food is seriously good, especially for a coffee shop. The breakfast items and pastries are way better than you'd expect. And they have cinnamon rolls 🔥. 

The aesthetic is modern with an artsy twist; neon signs, art-adorned walls, and sleek finishes everywhere. It's a nice departure from the industrial chic style you see in most places. Very IG and TikTok friendly, but still warm and welcoming.  ",https://coffeerepub.com/trade-st/,35.231006799999996,-80.8467915,"[""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxf00RLQ2rKxC4NkdSud2yiPCidgYMKVDKK97-=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_3HDKckK3GHHVgC_G1KduZZzTdyzYG-G-RuSz=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhdL2m5oRyICu29B1M4ok51HtJtMb6P2OWe-Co=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbag5HTfrW86pRigE5hDo0dcTN13N9WgE8lXWL=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPB-gyHYeC4FeZw-Pz04NKUSzwdAqf9sQfaHRuv=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxFzu2pTfp9ftxhGdspzdPSlGMCejdHALcSahN=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRlXHYNw04zXV82pIR0H0trEh7Oq3i9XDJNPi5=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6AwPSdiwl6_EMW7wiQ1F62DbrrijHM-WoRMzQ=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOv7Osx09qQjjV6qjkV2XxD6BrlLLzJk6cGbKY2=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://streetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com/v1/thumbnail?panoid=5fBpK1x71AxjNJPZJ-c35A&cb_client=maps_sv.tactile.gps&w=1600&h=1000&yaw=36.126&pitch=0&thumbfov=100"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxMyHt1M1QHZkZhTisnmTImwk_JHUEFdDRDUPW=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqdu-8Vu8RJaH4bie_Mo3RaLdmow5C5gGFaR2T=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8eTUCxILTCVlA9zqX_RoQ9yeSyjfY6R-oTcf2=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRBlE2QSAYgpjk52YYLo-s-ME_qqe_u6gptlyW=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjsDOiCuNYNjLwDz_d2vBT3VW7MvmNiDa5E3_Q=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeI3ijgLK5tjB4bizxZisJt1xGWkJgrxJe5YAt=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMo_9Gz9PWuEE982WBBxHTZiewUn98yf97R7qXn=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhmPqZjrGMkoy42gxHDc9BN3Eyer7kb5Hg-xKH=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRUcisH2lHaUCxmcPYQjt7_O1fPvsIhZYcpUYD=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipML3OQFlizBgW0Vw_88sbEJ_IBL54rqcYPPg1Wy=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNa5ubl9yy8bQ2f4ywjhG-pvInrFf7JETyY__yL=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSNxYUOSfGAVO62zBU-IKxhyMUZEudy1K-SA-7=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcLQ_nm8DTzqE-laNR2rBjMHInlP40jQ8NUJkq=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1KvF9RoLw4GAoW_DcpXwIUOgOc98PFfbtxIpF=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdDRZx7EHhCH-sgE4DrdhHq31ZEMz0wo5z2u34=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPcDfr3p0HrwW3WgF3x0ckzeB5NK7YRxmvqT9_=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1vTyvgmNxBRGc9fcS4tBLjaT-u9VTHH8h17e9=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKorCdL1w4C0fYC6tKJFn8DaTNs4-bOvYCEUFn=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJ84LnpD07QHpcgqLGnWVk_IKwJFIgkTSqGrk6=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQeYP8-92rkAwdSdQhZTNIJxTM0WkDbI411OaB=w2048-h2048-k-no""]",,https://www.tiktok.com/@coffeerepublic,https://www.instagram.com/coffeerepublicnc,,https://www.facebook.com/coffeerepubco,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/coffee-republic-and-bakery,9/8/2025 12:20pm,4/5/2025 11:35am,,11/6/2025 9:33am

Whether you're meeting friends or enjoying a quiet moment, every sip and bite is crafted to brighten your day.","The kind of spot that makes you feel at home the second you walk in. It's set in a converted house, cozy, super chill, and perfect whether you're getting work done, catching up with a friend, or just existing for a bit. The owner is incredibly welcoming, and you can tell he knows his regulars by name. The coffee hits (or so I've been told, I'm a tea drinker, and they have that as well), and the baked goods are fire. 

I haven't seen cinnamon rolls, but the range of pastries more than makes up for it. The banana nut bread and red velvet cookies are 🔥.

Wooden floors, brick walls, and loud and proud patriotism, definitely a great place to hit up on the Fourth of July. They don't have actual cinnamon rolls, but they do have a cinnamon roll-inspired coffee, which some folks (not me) might argue is even better. Most of the seating is at high tables, with a few spots by the window. There's not a ton of indoor seating, but plenty outside, so on warm days that's no issue. 

Outlet access indoors is excellent. It's right in the heart of downtown Kannapolis, surrounded by cool shops and local attractions. Great date spot. You can walk over to The Spice and Tea Exchange, one of my favorite places in the region for every kind of herbal tea imaginable (I'm a tea person). 

There's also a ballpark nearby if you're into baseball, or you can just stroll the row of shops outside. A great hangout if you're tired of Charlotte's ""everything is new and pristine and nothing feels lived in"" aesthetic.

As you step inside, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the scent of well-loved books, creating an inviting atmosphere that sparks creativity and relaxation.

The space is adorned with shelves stacked high with a curated selection of both new releases and timeless classics, inviting patrons to explore literary worlds while savoring a cup of their favorite brew. You can also find a selection of gently used books!

The coffee offerings are equally enticing, with expertly crafted espresso drinks, teas, and Lotus Energy drinks!","I love this place. It's exactly what the name suggests, a coffee shop and a bookstore, but inside a converted house. I already love libraries and bookstores in general, but this one adds a full coffee shop while still keeping that traditional bookstore vibe, not the chic, trendy setup you get at Barnes & Noble these days. 

You'll see writing groups meeting to share their latest work, book clubs gathering, friends chatting, students doing homework, and people on their own reading, working, or browsing the shelves. I wish I lived closer so I could go more often. 

There's great access to outlets at the seating spots near the windows, and they even put sticky notes with the Wi-Fi info nearby, which I appreciate. There's a certain seat where you can see the road to your left and the train tracks to your right, so you can watch cars and trains go by. Main character, ""my life is a movie"" energy. 

Books are everywhere. They've made smart use of the space. Even when it's busy, if you peek around, you can usually find a place to sit. And while it's a coffee shop, they have an expansive tea menu. They've got a whole range of flavors, hot or cold. The respect for tea lovers is real 👏🏾💯. 

If you've ever been to Brakeman's in Matthews or Backyard Brew in Dilworth, also coffee shops in converted homes, it's like that but bigger and with a bookstore. There's plenty of parking, but just a heads-up, the entrance is a bit up the road across from the church.

Wooden chairs, cowhide rugs, plenty of art on the walls, Bohemian vibes, and reading lamps scattered across tables. Someone put real care into this space, and it shows.

More than anything, though, I have to praise the cinnamon rolls they get from Honeybear Bake Shop in Charlotte. They have cream cheese frosting with a hint of maple flavor that seeps perfectly into the roll. As a self-proclaimed cinnamon roll connoisseur, it's fantastic. The sheer size combined with the standout frosting puts it on another level. Cream cheese frosting is famously difficult to get right on cinnamon rolls, so the quality of this one is all the more impressive. Until the day I had this cinnamon roll, I was convinced Sunflour Bakery had the best in greater Charlotte. Now I’m in doubt. Honeybear Bake Shop is serious business, and Mattie Ruth’s is blessed for carrying their rolls.

It's two stories with fewer stalls, which makes it feel more intimate and less overwhelming. Parking is plentiful and free, and it has a down-to-earth vibe rather than the trendy ""you have to try this omg"" TikTok energy Optimist has these days.

The market itself is a third place, but within it, you've got Luck Factory Games on the lower level with its own café, board games, bar, and snacks. Then there's Kunu Coffee Co., and if that's not enough, you can walk across the street to Mattie Ruth's Coffee. If you make the drive out here, it's worth it. 

You can hang out all day, grab food, coffee, or tea, relax for a bit, and if you're into it, grab a drink at High Branch Brewing Co., which is on the lower level.

They’re now in the spot that used to be Queen City Grounds. There’s plenty of seating thanks to the upstairs loft. If it’s packed downstairs, head upstairs and you should be able to find something. There’s solid outlet access up there too, and some good corners downstairs as well.

What I love most here is the massive selection of loose-leaf teas. There's a reason why ""Tea"" appears first in the business name. There's well over 20 options, ranging from black to oolong to green to herbal. It'd take some time to try them all, which is an incentive to keep coming back here. As someone that's been to nearly every coffee shop in Charlotte despite not drinking coffee (I go for the vibes), I deeply appreciate this place putting some respeck on tea.

Also, the owner must really love plants because there are plants everywhere. Real ones, the kind that need sunlight and water. It gives the shop a completely different vibe and feel than when it was Queen City Grounds, and I like it. There’s artwork on the walls too, including a mural of flowery-looking stuff on the back wall near the restrooms.

Parking is paid, either on the street or in the garage behind the building that’s shared with the apartments. This is a solid place to work remotely in Uptown.

Not industrial chic, just straight-up industrial, with everything needed to run a coffee shop, bakery, and ice cream shop all in one.

The bakery has cinnamon rolls🔥🙌🏾. And they're of a quality rivaling some of the regions best. It’s a large, generously iced masterpiece with frosting that somehow tastes like vanilla ice cream. I don’t know how they did it, but I’ve never had anything like it. And because of that, it’s just as good cold as it is warm. Ingenious. Bravo to the baker.

The shop itself is small, but the building is huge, with plenty of space to explore, sit, and spread out. There’s a pub upstairs (stairs are on the opposite end of the building from the coffee shop) serving food, drinks, and all the usual pub fare, plus a golf simulator up there as well.

📍 Rock Hill, SC | Serving the Charlotte, NC area","A French bakery that, to me, feels closer to authentic French pastries than our beloved Charlotte staple, Amélie's. The croissants, in particular, are incredibly buttery, flaky, and just downright good. No cinnamon rolls, but to be fair, they’re not a traditional French pastry. They’re staying authentic, and I respect that.

The space has a rustic aesthetic, featuring a fireplace and a massive vault door that I can only assume was once part of a bank. Now, it houses a pair of couches and a coffee table. An interesting touch for sure. Compared to Charlotte’s more ritzy, modern cafés, this one feels refreshingly down-to-earth, in the best way possible.",https://facebook.com/MadoParisBakery/,34.9503159,-81.0189604,"['https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gps-cs-s/AB5caB-QZZfhJRvyi7HguqfrjyOBdOuH77XWe_PrMNh0X2PPfxxGT9jqGXQr-f-DCRrjTDzxj_7fqQTTVmUg-ueH2tqcqLkHSNkUIMdskgZB5BN30v-KnoOwW8JoPxUWBpavpjkccvGj=w2048-h2048-k-no',

Bright and energetic vibe, making it a solid spot for working, studying, and staying awake. There’s a moderate amount of seating. Not a lot, but enough that you can feel reasonably confident about finding a spot if you go during a non-peak time. 

But most importantly, they have cinnamon rolls 🔥💯. And not just any cinnamon rolls. These are sourdough-based with cream cheese frosting. I believe they’re from a local bakery, and they’re good. Surprisingly, they taste better cold than warm, though they’re great either way. Cream cheese frosting tends to struggle with heat. It’s a delicate science to get the right temperature without it melting into a soupy mess on the plate. Anyways, great spot.

We are a Turkish style coffee shop located in Charlotte, NC. Our coffee is brewed using the traditional Turkish method, which results in a rich and flavorful cup of coffee. We only use the highest quality beans, and our coffee is always fresh and delicious.","One of Charlotte's most beautiful coffee shops. If you've been to Haraz or Qahwah House, it's similar, but in my opinion, better than both, in terms of design, not the coffee.

The decor is fully Turkish/Middle Eastern-inspired, with golden accents, vibrant colors, plants scattered throughout, and hanging bookshelves adorning the ceilings on the far ends. The walls are covered with emblems and engravings, there's a spacious patio in addition to a spacious indoor area. There's also a coffee bean tree-looking centerpiece that looks cool.

They serve coffee, tea, food, pastries, and some seriously good cheesecake. The two long tables inside offer good access to outlets, but the seating can be awkward. The chairs are tightly packed near the plants, making it difficult to reach your seat without stepping over others unless you're seated at the ends.

If anyone's having a conversation, everyone can hear them, making noise cancelling headphones a must if you're looking to study/work. 

Lots of cool Christian-themed art and inspirational quotes on the walls. It strikes a balance between feeling like an authentic local coffee shop while still having a modern touch in its design. Great spot. If you visit, also check out New Asia Market around the corner. Inside, there’s a quality Chinese food spot, and the store is packed with snacks, candies, spices, teas, and specialty foods from various Asian cultures, some of which you won’t even find at Super G Mart.

Offers expertly brewed coffee, pastries, and a lofted workspace.","Feels like a hidden gem. Hardly ever busy, maybe it hasn't been discovered yet by the IG/TikTok Charlotte coffee shop crowd. For that reason, it's very chill, and the music is amazing. Whoever chooses the playlist does an excellent job. Calming indie, easy listening, classic rock, a few pop hits here and there, all good clean, happy, vibrant, fun vibes.

This is attached to a newer (as of 2025) apartment complex called Elan LoSo. It's giving ""posh, elegant, modern"". But say all those words in a French accent. A mix of crisp whites, natural greens with plants here and there, and gold accents on the light fixtures. Bravo to the interior designer of this place. The aesthetic is lovely.

The upstairs area is part of the coffee shop, and it's a gem. It's small, only 3 seating options, but they've adorned the overhang with plants, there's a restroom, it's carpeted, and 2 of the 3 seating options have outlet access. The coziest of cozy nooks. If you can get an upstairs spot, good for you. Downstairs is nice as well, a few two-person tables, couches, and coffee bar seating with outlets.

Parking is tight, it's around the corner in a garage, paid and 2-hour limited. But there's a few street spots (you'll have to parallel park) that are free and not time limited. Overall, a lovely coffee shop. There's another Night Swim around the corner on Old Pineville Road that's bigger, so if you can't find a spot (or parking) here, mosey on over there.",https://nightswimcoffee.com/,35.1844123,-80.88223579999999,"[""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBBgrRwpq9DUC0EtqvIRNKO_4U8wID-6ds1e5c=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPp0U0isuCQSLvcuukT3atfe8v8WCuKYd9LMnl0=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM13FK1MBoq0c8dFltrOb9-4_IjCClCv7Wok2yP=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://streetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com/v1/thumbnail?panoid=6Mvf98fN9tQhQeyIwIsI0w&cb_client=maps_sv.tactile.gps&w=1600&h=1000&yaw=219.26979&pitch=0&thumbfov=100"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNV72iIUF6wjcoJF-3d3hEAhlF5gzcWij4k4C0O=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTbEAbhJwtDfgzpJ74jBeDpXaKJZL-2zHIMHnf=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJLhiXzDuOkk2022t3-inkvTM6ubw_GGX8VdyX=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeMHdx9bLWlyy7pMwhwOL2EhxDWHazl44_Vcxw=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCtNrg1y446PAtIPpXMRuDzFB-in2YmPoSYdnc=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0JL4eVXIcbswNJhW6G-eJrTircmvO7dqUstdt=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN90wfoHCwjahcqjxfd3yDZxzYUxicG-vRQE5xK=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOixwLCni9MH2_t6MI3_jPfg1VkcZx5z-Yg02tB=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWB0Bjwd-HLZInWj5c4rHMC-dnmuj9BcUjQky1=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4mQCLErLWob6zlVRzYITHIxLoB8HITFy8lBRG=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIrZC-RQ9ayRS8qo_4NYyS9Oa_wei-0P5P178G=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmWqqChLyl7Dx7Cry5Vy_KK_938Jg0Eh2w-nuu=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMkZxtnO5crzntEGsuJwbXXedIxAjXrOctq3HD=w2048-h2048-k-no""]",,https://www.tiktok.com/@nightswimcoffee,https://www.instagram.com/nightswimcoffee/,,https://www.facebook.com/nightswimcoffee/,https://x.com/NightSwimCoffee/,,11/4/2025 10:38am,2/5/2025 5:59pm,,11/6/2025 9:33am

When you arrive, the big sign says ""Visart Video"" but that's not where you enter for the cafe. Go around the corner down the long walkway, you'll pass a bunch of tables and chairs. That's a good chunk of the seating, outside, but there’s additional seating indoors through a door you pass walking in.

The indoor area has this dark room, film auteur, sort of vibe. Movie posters all around, various art pieces, very cool. There's a mini movie theater that's down to earth. Nothing fancy, a simple small screen, individual chairs, that aren't particularly comfortable but are enough to sit and enjoy a film. 

If you get there early enough in the day, they'll let you pick a movie to put on. I got to watch Things We Lost in the Fire (featuring Halle Berry & Benicio Del Toro, a beautifully moving drama) and Reign of Fire (featuring Christian Bale & Matthew McConaughey, an underrated turn your brain off film) on a rainy Wednesday morning while half-working on my laptop in a corner. I don't know any other third places in Charlotte where you can do that!

This is also a great place to hang out if it's warm, there’s outlets outdoors. It’s right by an awesome local bookstore, Book Buyers, so you can get your drinks, browse the video store, and then browse the bookstore, all within walking distance. And a final story, the first time I visited, a dude had the indoors booked to propose to his girlfriend. She was elated, I suspect they met here. So, it could be said the vibes here are...lovely ❤️.",http://www.visartvideo.org/,35.214056,-80.78263799999999,"[""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAQgisbMpZ4mCyJYJ1L7rJTd68YbLMynJ2mpuu=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGgzujEp018_6x5D4WMZHi7FLQyVtvltap5Nhk=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoL-uA6nzSM0nJ5ve5GWabmG8iFP63I-9ff7vj=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNretWKRYUUtES4X09eOB7MeE2mnAK0Ebp5S18U=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTcLvtrACA4a8Ap4Ys3JXrpxe9ZNkNu_gT5GOX=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzlT-bDCe7L6jRD_y9PeOotxn05qFr_yv1rj6q=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4KeKmK-yXJMp62LpTkhoULKlJkm0COZIEe8Ul=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://streetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com/v1/thumbnail?panoid=RavYu9RV5dwJrWgKLiqiLA&cb_client=maps_sv.tactile.gps&w=1600&h=1000&yaw=132.51866&pitch=0&thumbfov=100"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtuFqIp5m3Y-CEuziQzShKYv-gYXd9xu6oso2r=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvtZy-4UD6TXHn3AWrdiiOscbsjyKqdOW7wRes=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVoo6mqMPrIzb23UbIHIOqPdQKDqVqLZU584La=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyT4QRW32IYjnFrLDrlnm37U8_mbJJTwCkLkfZ=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNm6iaDGd8wdxWay0YHCqo50SiEIqOJqdMV2L78=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_oUdZMAR-npdeJg48bjHGZ6PlPeud29QsKlSO=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzqAEeWpGvLPrEtDGRf8IP3fwmTwfsRj5aH2Wc=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCvo4Hu6tNcNOLsSw5Y2z_QR-ECWOgSFaB4YfS=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpeSmzciR_1I528YRwpFn6ZbwU-l1vu3eickl0=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwFvCfYCcoTHfLzSLMX4_5wIQhXASU-EdV2uyM=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSF3g6sKwUSpgmmwDRVnnDf59fX8Hh0f8QpWxn=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOX7g5jZ9mRsRSBCFCnw9CB0cNc-Zbzy8xQIk9J=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqMoiT1_NZrA0jDAOp7pz9Kzb5lz6raJeMGSPq=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpJfDbRNXsEE_MUw7t608jHDwC9VfDlgcBaLCB=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP65HpRA-dh-jx6pRU2_he0JxGztNv70xK1pHEV=w2048-h2048-k-no""]",,https://www.tiktok.com/@visartcafe,https://www.instagram.com/visartvideo/,https://www.youtube.com/@visartvideo,,,,11/19/2025 6:12pm,1/25/2025 12:17pm,,11/6/2025 9:33am

We’d love for you to think of us as an extension of your home or business.,"This used to be the beloved spot Unwind Tea & Coffee before it was bought by Waterbean. The new Waterbean opened in the Fall of 2022, and while it doesn't have the same decor as Unwind, it maintains the respect the former had for tea.

They have a shelf with at least 20 tea options in small demo canisters that you can pick up and smell to make your choice. The interior setup makes great use of the space, plenty of spots for individual seating plus a few larger tables for groups. It's always weird sitting at a table meant for four when you're just there to study or work on your laptop alone. You won't have that problem here.

Great access to outlets, big windows that let in a lot of light, and a really good sandwich called the Waterbean Special, try it!

After four years of word-of-mouth growth, I expanded into ‘Littl Madeleine,’ a charming Korean cafe offering madeleines, scones, cookies, cheesecakes, and other Korean treats. At Littl ♡ Madeleine, every madeleine, scone, cookie, and cake is crafted exclusively with organic flour, organic sugar, organic milk, organic honey, organic eggs, AA-grade butter, and pure heavy cream. We handcraft everything in small batches, ensuring it’s fresh and real, and only make what we truly love, so we can confidently recommend each item to our customers. Gratefully, Sadie","A standout among the many coffee shops and bakeries in Charlotte. While they don't have cinnamon rolls 😞, they have very unique cheesecakes that are worth trying. There always seems to be a few couples on dates here, and I can see why. It's got that cute, clean, minimalist aesthetic: all white with subtle pops of color, like a doctor's office but way cozier. The kind of interior that TikTok/Instagram influencers would love.

It's also laptop friendly with solid outlet access and some small tables fit for one or two. I like that most of the seating is blocked by walls so that you can't see the order area. So when people are waiting in line, standing around, checking out the bakery, if you're seated you mostly can't see them. That's such a good interior design thing to me.

If I lived closer, this would be my favorite of all their locations. It feels lived in, down to earth, authentic. A tip, if you can’t find parking out front, drive to the street behind the building, there’s more there. And across all their locations, Sunflour Bakery has some of the best cinnamon rolls in Charlotte.

The sandwiches are also good, I suggest the Sunny Special on a cheddar biscuit, it’s huge. They also serve Rishi teas, a standout as far as bagged teas go. The orange blossom green tea is 🤌🏾👏🏾. Now, nothing here is cheap. You'll get like 2 things and spend $20, but it all tastes good, so it's worth the splurge every once in a while.",https://sunflourbakingcompany.com/pages/harrisburg-nc-bakery,35.3216833,-80.6597862,"[""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlG2QdBlRoq344liv8R92_eVNWRtpOFS_g9zMr=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYUGJ2KMcO6h0nOvOom13cbx05nNUiY3n4re_1=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1PW_gGiHLA7d513GF9UyU8MfVYPGyZaCFeJEc=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCocOfVH7qOSMohVa14H2Pp2MtIA8s8izfsX89=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyZqzmoUkXhgLVIMmW19rWNjos3Ha0rZ2j53Kw=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_vrZbskjaS6e43wnR2e4z4E8P36SNBNXJIKU7=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOvzkP2ptg2v0PH9vfx3_CXt3KG230oaUbvd99=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8VAAndsQi3UjBxpZkJCms92NBVOqAKrvC6W48=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWgCsPydy7kNj-bnfPcAls1Y2qqZslJJsAa6aC=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvj5ebugv6fyOCPfpoDzib1vHyHPy7UpZlLuXY=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUvuSI79R-XUqEN-ufvQG_gmBxL-hg_FV_qZsE=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMCkPtoGb92WfuwQB8HYrcBW0zeNL_5sd7icK_=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6wr8hmbLDiFphkftF2G7hK7ITQyhcV0mPn_0O=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0fNhJoP0NcjIeDv8TXoVK_uk9QDpgFwu-OZ7r=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0_rltIIwX-izXi5-tplvejSSHikCS_3-Jthyj=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLGRZ4cCZ40tvILOdFHeLbhbAoTpLuJniNduBl=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNy3QqcSQzY0Q-Iw4LXaMG2ReEqHG5pmCSbuFij=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOufQKRE_Lkc1ObNSBHn5cY3vww5hWmmWhp7Oxq=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqxhHO6bsmw-lt_A3QajNFqLpXGkHL0GHKY4Ut=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0-1u_t4Yz4Yx89FND7XIFlOVcPGmR0pNalEXf=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNo3jwZ_89WYQ1UGgvRuSsU6Ua58Pqlu9Dy2va_=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCbPqJs6KPghelclOHFaSU-hqwrBG8hIQrm8s6=w2048-h2048-k-no""]",,https://www.tiktok.com/@sunflourbakingcompany,https://www.instagram.com/sunflourbakingcompany/,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb4J7fEwUt1hJXiivrFlJ_Q,https://www.facebook.com/sunflourbaking/,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/sunflour-baking-company,11/4/2025 11:01am,12/7/2024 1:39pm,,11/6/2025 9:33am

It's connected to Bank of America, Blumenthal Performing Arts Center, and the Overstreet Mall. The 2024 redesign added tons of comfy seating and outlet towers so you can easily stay charged. There's several free Wi-Fi options (try another network if one acts up) and a Caribou Coffee for drinks and snacks. The downside is it's Uptown, so no free parking. I'd suggest parking in the Bank of America Corporate Center Garage—take the elevator to the 6th floor, and you’re inside Founders Hall. There's security guards everywhere, to the point where it's like ""ayo calm down"". They on every corner. You'll never feel safer than you will hanging out here. Upstairs near Caribou there’s a game room open to the public called The Lounge with ping pong, mini golf, a pool table, arcade games, and overpriced snacks. Around the corner from Caribou, you'll find a Post Office, a small library, and a path to the Overstreet Mall with more food options. You can explore most of Uptown indoors via the skywalks that connect the big buildings. This place is totally worth an Uptown day trip. Work/study then explore and go to an evening event (Hornets game, Middle C Jazz, Blumenthal show) to justify the price of parking.",https://www.foundershallevents.com/,35.227559899999996,-80.8420664,"[""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmhTu3mO87SThc58rF6r23LM7xtVHEUZKj0EYI=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvTi0JmdXiXuQqgndYtToPD10Moqr3nudTh8-G=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOc6K3QwqTLZwKoqhmVyFbejBsWG_fFkUUDf60X=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSKksFshm7BeiFAT-S1xuT6MwjzZhZ_BNjoUiX=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMt3wPWlDjJnjh9rpljmIj16VNmUFZa--ZD36mv=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1rdJa2Ck0VWjwM7f6I10opVNjmalVpUUwQyrb=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBttLvKZ4aISgbpzcH2h1l2ldn6e94BknTNbaV=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTZM_jEzwiImdTEKMdUlRim2_WpZBiOosYU4KX=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMy1iCGZMWK9obTeRQW6Q_gKjgRpzurnzkPjTYa=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjWNuVJ55liWfex-kNN8XooQ9fX1LfKGXsnjq9=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_ZdmbtqAdBOJKaouQkb7nMwZJ2LXCFcAs6dO9=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGQsGs-V25Fyw9onjpl85P6AebeQPHjHNYVIKr=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2P0HaxKLHBRYn27zGMDo-7Vi-gi29g7EpJNKE=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMly0CxyJRLV5g-Sq4wKNV6tKYwVA7_ub57Y9y=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOTZQW2Bgzi6n3SFquDmwg32AI_I6Hhh_yhItd=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVDg2imXeq5kkxCOorwkqB-pSzIZXdpxlzNMcC=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhQuHQ6k3PnFvUfB98RDEDuNbfzzf3AgwCf_VS=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLGba0KIL8k4e-4aFXrkErZtsnKAGx5n14apfY=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvvG2pTG5uo1NuLQg_lwJkwQCOqayLmHPkd7e2=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnbGdQIYFzaLIcN0V25bPhwZOh_j3PvThLme0n=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuVAhGo2bAgGjVBKKDA2G4nvA-WPY42W8MwhNR=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8CyaJEqyM--pvfz7U5SvU9qBMQdSYam1EuoUT=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHNDrNCvzyOg5fhFChJJr83TciXKZ7E-1gsESg=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNm4apWRxx5_EaFgz8YvREFzDpsQLP4wp-tSCxE=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM79a_kKaPKVzoehPpLMmIOt7wwftHmhgOgfvCb=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnEOoQ4jnfICl256mJ_kVtocK2_RDrqeVS0dL3=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOv3gkwhumc7hNcAn1CvhHrldk3fA7rSNw1u8Q=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4eQ0gENOiZC1pAIb20ZYadJALzFo5xSwTK8ns=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJNo_2YNLzBSmIqRLF9vpAll8X3YkwEWekXu5m=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfzaPLVMcRDyiUSoqfOyW2mTDRKJoffouloh1X=w2048-h2048-k-no""]",,,,,,,,6/18/2025 9:04am,11/27/2024 9:12am,,11/6/2025 9:33am

Taking inspiration from European cafes, The Everyday Market offers a space for the community near and far to relax and escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life.

The team, led by pastry chef / owner Majid Amoorpour, are happy to be part of Belmont’s historic downtown and would love for you to come spend some time with us.

The second Everyday Market location recently opened in the vibrant Lower South End district of Charlotte, NC.","Lots of food options, coffee, tea, pastries, and various market items for individual purchase. Parking is free but limited in terms of store dedicated spots. There’s additional Belmont downtown parking though. You might have to drive around a bit to find a spot if you go during peak hours, but Belmont is very walkable. I’d say walking around downtown Belmont to get here is a part of the attraction. There’s plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, although it’s popular enough to get crowded around lunch time. There’s a nice park and walking trail across the street. Limited access to outlets, but so long as you’re charged up, it’s a great place to hangout. Start here, eat, drink, then explore Belmont.",http://www.everydaymarketbelmont.com/,35.2420275,-81.0378276,"[""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEJMINzwN9A4BaB8bxLwF6ieE3QUBijDOtxMLd=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUZumEicAjTloPLl8wfzH66rKfLzhxav66XEmT=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5Icli-nlws-kR_H1vVsZU-WY_ambJ8OW3p3PE=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODqsy49IhRhMIEbkoKugYACvvCnlGT-9cRf7OA=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhYSfUyx6Ko3xgmtg8I_7bfnMac1yqxdFlnAPm=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPg7ozdHpe7jwJ5qyXq8UDElr1yDuaDbPLRoxIP=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtYJT4ZIXG6ttg-aVCgZODKcw1VNSMvbT_UQnc=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHx5oOBvZjcLwr7_a5Ob4SBUGVFlThXmel6aTi=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7hzr152MwiNlmpEn8JLpJZhbe7PCMFH_vhUC4=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzZZM8W8GIW-FEw0JxshlYR4CEcyKwwyQIX5kP=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNORaqtoXitVqoVP7eNm9MPXu_I0hcRbGz2Y3MT=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaaHFa_CKVsp5Ek-YEZ4d98lU0xznWjC7pE05G=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6CTa2s2bmSGHpfG4RK9S17avTrKKhSanwQqpL=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4sWmhXcdjC2ncesJI39wgHN-wK-Byaa5jXaeZ=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbZzN6U8EtZfn6f1HTuuyECr9bS3DhCRWx78Me=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMn4ie9w9AduQEda1bG7kVgNQljUNlIZtOx3ztd=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjMgh82iyy-KDnLrCDi1VZy_GlQVGNYuktvWkA=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjKh3lYdtKUDmVNVfHHERk48KjqUNepQzoGSzO=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKQE5npV85PLrDpqr1NTScU4Jsr7o1L8-kjsCP=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNU6ByrNya7sxUXA1q-S09TZ4zp6xlOJ2z3jBzK=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIC-Hw92ni74wxPYto0DguHE2c__kMAz0W6WWa=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGl4ao-DQnsBtyT_vWK1wQJLPXAY4s2OJPMHLh=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqp_3dP7KrbMt-nz9fdXTv1cfbxDWqzgjSs-W3=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKtXJSa-o-W_9R6TGvtcMQI89vyG2kBKI5cNSH=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxirR2AdSH6Ql2X8NXBfjhq1ehDoCGUOjEtSw-=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzGO2v9V169zF2Wc7q17d4ApcgGkJjMTtuMEVp=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyOkW2tdT2P3h5W9TaFNxoa78TVN_6sc-eXIwz=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcIwZUuJbx-lZy4igpu1F-9UPgcs78l4A1Fk2X=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmxN_9JrCTWlrniWPnmYSd81xPfCfrUJXeHhj-=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLYJ2CmHSMM164NK27HB_2mt9JlJj0eDMiI5nw=w2048-h2048-k-no""]",,,,,,,,11/4/2025 11:21am,10/20/2024 7:12am,,11/6/2025 9:33am

The Trailhead Store also often hosts events free to the public, such as our Pickin' on the Porch music series and outdoor yoga.

The Waterbean Special sandwich is amazing, and I continue to love their dedication to providing an abundance of loose-leaf herbal tea options.

Whether grabbing a quick cup or relaxing with friends, our café is your go-to spot for quality coffee and treats.","Lots of food and pastry options that all look great, including cinnamon rolls from time to time. But not a ton of comfortable seating options. Downstairs is all high-top bar-style seating with your back facing the entrance and checkout area, so everyone coming in is walking directly behind you. The TikTok feng shui guy would say that’s not good design.

There’s an upstairs area too, but it’s super compact. A big table, a couch, and some smaller tables and chairs are all squeezed in tightly. If you go early and claim a good seat, it could work as a place to get things done. But if not, I wouldn’t call it cozy or comfortable.

If you come here to work or study and can't find a spot, whip around the corner to Panera Bread. It’s big and you’ll almost definitely find seating. Sunflour Bakery (my favorite of all their locations), Summit Coffee, and Starbucks are all nearby too.

Yemen is where coffee was invented and later flourished in global trade. Roasting and serving coffee is something that is inclusive of all people and cultures, and brings people together. Our coffee is grown from altitudes over 3,000 ft in a mountainous village called Haraz, where our namesake originates.","Immaculate vibes.

They are all great spots to hang out, get work done, catch up with friends or enjoy some quiet time. We are sure you will love our bright, friendly interiors and of course our pastry case.","They have what I consider to be the best cinnamon rolls in Charlotte. I suggest getting two, eat one right away, and save the other for eating at home after warming it up. As a general rule, I’d encourage you to refrain from offering your opinion about a cinnamon roll until you’ve had it both cold and warm. Things can taste rather different heated up, flavors coming out, for better or worse. They can sell out of cinnamon rolls pretty quickly sometimes though, if you show up after like 11 AM, no guarantees. The sandwiches are also pretty good. Be warned though, the whole menu is expensive. Like, I’ll go in here and buy 2 things and get asked for $28 and be just flabbergasted. But the cinnamon rolls, they wash it all away. So it’s worth it.

We serve fresh made sandwiches every day of the week. Visit us on East 7th Street today, or shop online and ship fresh baked goods nationwide.","They have what I consider to be the best cinnamon rolls in Charlotte.

Things can taste rather different heated up, flavors coming out, for better or worse. They can sell out of cinnamon rolls pretty quickly sometimes though, if you show up after like 11 AM, no guarantees. The sandwiches are also pretty good.

The upstairs area above the stadium style seating has some excellent tucked away spots, great for feeling cozy, and outlet access excellent all throughout the store. 

You can sit in the hotel as well if need be. It’s one of Charlotte’s best coffee shops in terms of space, vibes, aesthetic, and convenience for students and remote workers wanting to stay a while.

Very alt-punk/rock aesthetic, which I personally love since I grew up in Seattle. It feels like the kind of spot the crew from a 2000s coming-of-age film (the ones who get bullied by the popular kids and listen to Radiohead, Dashboard Confessional, Mayday Parade, My Chemical Romance,  Boys Like Girls, All Time Low, and Yellowcard) would hang out at, talking through their trauma and how much they want to ""get out of this town."" 

And I mean that in the best way possible (I may have just listed some of my favorite bands). This place is awesome. The sandwiches are great. The music is on point. I don’t even bother with headphones unless it’s packed. Truly a standout when it comes to vibes. I'm surprised it's not busier, I consider it a hidden gem in South End. There's a lunch crowd, but outside of that on weekdays during work hours it's pretty chill. 

For remote work, there’s some access to outlets upstairs, and 1-2 downstairs by the vending machine, but not a lot overall, so come charged up. If you’re a morning person, you can practically have the whole place to yourself if you show up early. It doesn’t get busy until the afternoon. The outdoor seating is also great and plentiful.

Parking is the biggest challenge here. There’s free parking near the store, but it’s limited. Street parking and nearby lots are options, though not always free. South End is designed for walking and light rail access, which is great unless you’re coming from another neighborhood and need your car. Not complaining though, just making a note.",https://commonmarketisgood.com/south-end/,35.2103963,-80.8636397,"[""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMh0-mO8dLAybt2OoeuNl1sEZQgMXf71XpXGot=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM35AeTs1Q_7fTpORgTPyndBh_kMai0uX6wTq4Y=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPV9TLe2yWAhzMiFzJeiHmxd_w489wiGNQ9smwx=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNo32FGhOQUQJa3kBu5vF1m546u5Ai8IQOdeY74=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkG57Xv6nuyK_dCrC1LzKtDa1IgKVaKXDZGK8w=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxrSbu8XtHJ9ZYDMKCzC1t5w1qJgGSHU3rGKA0=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrVFBmBhQwbGzv6_zuCKQda-iJpjIbPrzMZK-X=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOi4yjc6m-0KsOTeCEvtSqqyfq3XdTeW-SBqu-4=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyY_Ee7-we8CucLvqw6ApzwrbTJ-Rxg1dtbTob=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkWrdDQG4hQpyyJF9AB3E7ve5d35BhkxNcA10c=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOv7VMQzlEtm7J3wtL9E4xILR-DGZPzqK-zKQ1f=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0ZQHp-jyfwkX0N8SG0wzJygPBE7Makask6GGV=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYh6rHUC00Gbnm-Yejd3aczszphB1K80eaqb55=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOySjRxgO8wMiqJZ1PHs65vGKOaaZ8HOHxOWLEQ=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMepJBzqwU_dkrKYQtZOfBmxEte0AOZs-yXJrIL=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjy9AqWqMduRfffAapBa99Qacp22mqk2EdpRx7=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqkptJdaFVeTQKyW0R4JBCgcGvpZ_cFYSjQW6Z=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMpLf-0WY7gWeUFsOcS1WkETi_L-xF91ogDyV0=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNX4moSdqvTMXS-cJeacG0M_FkXnT9wjtiqqX-P=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7P5feFw4qhX5rAss2Pc6sW54rJIea1pw-uzlR=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCiOLJ_zwOjWfoTX-Lb9RhkbuBGz8QbcdgWD1Z=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipME5LeQHZDjQVP4pR_gc1QlHL7QYASiClh5Fld4=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfiaV2i_xvbW4VBDTQ0M1TdMB-DdHuquwuMSLy=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4h5KFisj0o15-hA4vGHDQbul_yM07IwVVEyeL=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4WTxB3zAhL4HxrYATNEUKES1DAGsQSF-QDd-e=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCr1xUueJ3icBmWSQKNQuIxBEI4lcAQisUcRmD=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4uf2_r6dBdUQsdiDccggrHkXBfAVi9MYzrxxC=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfooJby-Tx2mYMc94FORi__gKBgJDkrSrk9Pbm=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTEAGWpbYfA2cL0tpQBrTkW-vmtaCtk1DHWN4s=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9GSAj7wyXyka1nL8IZekqm6o0mhWeKgiRU0sK=w2048-h2048-k-no""]",,,https://www.instagram.com/thecommonmarketsouthend/,,https://www.facebook.com/commonmarketNC/,,,11/10/2025 8:53am,11/7/2022 10:12am,,11/6/2025 9:33am

Thoughtful coffee, beer, natural wines, and food.","They have orange flavored cinnamon rolls sometimes, which I suspect they get from the same place that The Hobbyist does. The aesthetic is what I'd describe as typical of South End. Trendy, industrial chic, unfinished floor, minimalist, vibes.

Parking is free, which is rare for South End, making it one of the better picks for those driving from different neighborhoods looking for a hangout spot.

That’s the word I’d use to describe this place. It feels a little hidden being upstairs, which somehow makes it even better. The music, the eclectic decor, the paintings, the random plants, the murals, everything about it just works. It’s cool. Or hip. That word fits too.

You could honestly film one of those “cool young people spreading peace, love, and unity while hanging out with a diverse group of friends” commercials here. And I mean that in the best way possible. I don’t really know how else to describe it. It’s just cool. The only thing that's not cool is parking. It's NoDa, you'll be lucky to find a free street spot, else its paid lots.

The pizza is good, and daytime on weekdays it isn't that busy, so it's a solid place to work remotely. There's a handful of spots with outlet access, and plenty of seating. I don't drink beer, but when I do, I prefer Dos Equis I've been told what they serve here is really good.

There’s maybe 1-2 couches in a corner downstairs, but upstairs they line the window that runs the length of the building. Excellent spots to read. Premium coziness.

Downstairs there’s a Starbucks with a bunch of seating. Only 3-4 spots that are near outlets though, so charge your laptop if you’re coming to work or study. Idk why but the Starbucks inside this Barnes & Nobles has different and way better food, drink, and snack options than normal Starbucks. 

This location has marvelous cookies. The salted caramel one is 10/10. And the hot tea options are way more expansive than normal Starbucks. Harney & Sons tea options, quality stuff. So as weird as this may sound, the Starbucks inside this Barnes & Nobles is a hidden gem in and of itself.

Perhaps the only downside here is it gets super busy. This place is flooded with students meeting their tutors and study groups weekdays after school. Although you can still usually find a spot somewhere. But after church on Sunday? Forget it. This place is packed. So, just time your visit well. I’ve found, if you have remote  work flexibility, it’s plenty tranquil 9 AM - 5 PM on weekdays. It’ll just be you, the staff, a few house moms, and other remote workers.

Amélie’s French Bakery & Café | Park Road,,Great Date Spot,"Bakery,Café",Large,Montford,"524 Brandywine Rd, Charlotte, NC 28209",ChIJvVxqVlSeVogRz786_h7uyiQ,https://maps.google.com/?cid=2651193147542650831,"https://maps.apple.com/?ll=35.1733556,-80.8473461&q=Am%C3%A9lie%E2%80%99s%20French%20Bakery%20%26%20Caf%C3%A9%20%7C%20Park%20Road",Yes,Free,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,"This charming gathering place draws a crowd for its pastries, light fare & coffee drinks.","One of my favorite third places in Charlotte. In fact, it was my first third place here. This location is spacious, bright, and thoughtfully designed. The ground floor has large tables that make it easy for groups to meet, and you’ll often see book clubs, church groups, and D&D squads gathered around. Even with all that activity, there always seems to be a seat for solo visitors.

The slightly raised seating area that runs the length of the building is perfect if you come alone. It’s lined with two-top tables and counters and feels a bit tucked away from the main floor. You can walk in, see families and groups filling the space, and still know there’s a quiet corner waiting for you.

Outlet access is excellent. Along the booth-style seats in the raised seating section, there’s a slim black strip beneath the padded backs with outlets. They are easy to miss, but they’re there. Someone clearly put effort into making sure people could stay a while.

Now for story time. I moved to Charlotte during the COVID-19 pandemic, which meant nearly everything worth exploring was closed. When things started reopening, smaller spots struggled with distancing, but larger ones like this Amelie’s found a way. They removed a few tables and still let people sit safely apart. After more than a year of being confined to my studio apartment, this became my first “just sit somewhere and be out of the house” spot. I would bring my laptop and a book, work remotely, watch shows, read, and just exist somewhere that wasn’t home.

I came here three or four times a week. The staff eventually started predicting my order, which is partly why I began branching out to other places. I felt I needed to be more adventurous. But this Amelie’s will always be special to me. It was my home away from home. I made my first friends in Charlotte here and saw so many others doing the same. People working, reading, studying, and talking. This spot embodies what a third place is supposed to be.

The food and pastries are alright. Nothing life-changing, but nothing bad either. The cinnamon roll is just okay, it’s gotten better. It used to be terrible, but since it’s not a French pastry, I give them a pass. The coffee is reliable, and the tea options are good. Pro tip, you can order a full pot of tea even though it’s not listed on the display menu. Between that, the pastries, and the welcoming atmosphere, everything here invites you to stay a while.

It may not be the original Amelie’s, but it’s my original. I pray it never goes away.",http://www.ameliesfrenchbakery.com/,35.1733556,-80.8473461,"[""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjjf3dVHRCvX__UC7ZrcX1x8_Ur6Z6XTrBuJo9=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpB_ljIxrnndDdJTN_23-tpVWQGyOT8KHGQA_e=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBEKJTyzFbOiWtRPFMgmhcg2c1t_SO6JeS3knm=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwFaxAJFPqu_mTPAm07vXaXsTJtOugSUeK4TOW=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtGEoymnstTPmU1v7qFaZsoc9CGt5B_pbNiWwX=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlIqXXaToAfy8m39FCIbcPOgwWSD9BfiLCMqAg=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTsoPHIRXmsPNaNFUbxQBbjAcvq2jOqfejrO3z=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqKQtRm8hpoumRtVndHb98jSfRKhllWUMAMwVd=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4JIzFwLiJkfwMTSi2rvQnI9QgFKrSJ6IpGG1W=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMyquCnxeLQIPZd_riPpwbkeTglV5d6InGuCgk=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdY07yY5qMqHg8mt6FlD_EIBQZeX125BoMVEzd=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPR067bAtNUi63-RA_dU4nxEGHBU3gtiM3_ErBG=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOL0h19Q6LONEnKuhTJ6o-WksX-BfxuI1XC4Kw5=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdfMk70z5lojZ2qhrv584e_lGXWuqhH7DzwQjJ=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMh3hqjsr314AKLQhPkYpL2djCDo_vmsd-SoS6R=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyIHDN6TE1BM97XPElARgc96BOUxVaL2xNibwF=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJsXRJKJYi_QzX6gCCQFyOig7QIWNdHogjfCIh=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIZi1naN0XABPPAEUd47FLN3O2hrmNFJGxWGwX=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcBz6hJ5ePAuQmrx9ZihyM_Ly3lJheDytqwKKX=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzsV4x4qqS1qxaLnJPcDycA2ExbsRDDbJVYyiP=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPP1Lu7_1sWHbiY2EoUuS_74f5g3825k2Qw4lCg=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPV0aU4vtTUeCr7FQ8p_QXrbrvm2jMO6M6vTXJI=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoDJfDJ-WXzQAvQGJIfy5E6xYA65VxaXcbfRM4=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrMOEy-LWx73vrb6w6fkxpjTCrpNbmcbY3YX1w=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtsqIwDojbhDWWDQ48-f6fWlRztigfl6sznX6M=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHNeKePoquy3htgpsi4IKcWRpgxsjTrrxowYI0=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNydxrssMd6hMxbUM1bvcDgNhxdChYNS-3aquE_=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSfdtxY5ZpCt28yof4oJqFN3V9GTbjpoitStsa=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqRPFabkf5s4YPiOJEYWH6ACRuDwc7uKRzjA9A=w2048-h2048-k-no"", ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLKo7SjuAJkYr_F0oFdramde_TBAg4DGl9ixsk=w2048-h2048-k-no""]",,https://www.tiktok.com/@ameliesfrenchbakery,https://www.instagram.com/ameliesfrenchbakery/,,,https://x.com/AmeliesBakery,https://www.linkedin.com/company/amelie-s-french-bakery,11/3/2025 3:30pm,11/5/2022 10:30pm,,11/6/2025 9:33am
