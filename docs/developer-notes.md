- To run locally with Incremental Static Regeneration and thus mirror production (visits will cache and be revalidated according to the set time) `cd` into `charlotte-third-places` and run `npm run build; npm start`.

**Or, simply use the `launch.json` file which has the above commands baked in as configurations**
