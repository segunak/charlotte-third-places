A scratch pad for various notes related to this project.

## Random Information

* To stop Azurite from writing its logs to undesirable locations I set the `Azurite: Location` in settings to the relative path (starting from the C:\ drive) `/GitHub/charlotte-third-places/azure-function/.azurite` The folder is ignored in the `.gitignore`.
* Testing locally, if you use `venv` you can get weird networking issues tunneling from the virtual environment to the public internet. If you're comfortable with your local environment don't bother with it.
* You need to place any third-party Python libraries in `requirements.txt` so they're installed in the cloud for use during deployments and production execution.
* Remember to start and stop Azurite for local testing.

## Azure Function

To debug the Azure Function locally, follow the guidance in the [quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-python). In summary, you'll need to do the following.

### Using Emulated Storage

1. Start the Azurite Blob Service. This can be done from the command panel `CTRL + Shift + P`.
2. Debug `function_app.py` with a `launch.json` file that looks like the [below JSON](#launch-file). Right now this configuration should be setup already in the `.vscode` folder.
3. Navigate to the Azure tab in the left bar and under Workspace expand Local Project. The function should be under there where you can right-click and execute it, providing your own body.

### Using Real Storage

1. Make sure in your `local.settings.json` file you have `AzureWebJobsStorage` set to the connection string of a storage account. The format is `DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=charlottethirdplaces;AccountKey=[AccountKeyHere];EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net`
2. Debug `function_app.py` with a `launch.json` file that looks like the [below JSON](#launch-file). Right now this configuration should be setup already in the `.vscode` folder.
3. Navigate to the Azure tab in the left bar and under Workspace expand Local Project. The function should be under there where you can right-click and execute it, providing your own body.

### Troubleshooting

Tips on troubleshooting weird stuff with the Azure Function.

If the local deploy from VSCode is showing `getaddrinfo enotfound` as an error messsage, flush your DNS using `ipconfig /flushdns` and wait a minute or two before trying again.

I ran into the issue where you deploy the Azure Function, either from VSCode locally or from a GitHub action, and the deployment goes green, but the Azure Function disappears from the portal. What an annoying issue that is. The reasons for this can be numerous, read through [this thread](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-python-worker/issues/1338) and [this thread](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-python-worker/issues/1262) and [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/1cuz049/azure_function_swallows_a_build_error_no_way_to/) for things people have done to fix this issue. The answer is, you could be doing many things wrong, you need to dig deep to figure out which is your issue. In my case, the structure of the directory being uploaded when I started using a GitHub action was wrong. The GitHub action I had initially was generated by Azure using their GitHub integration feature, and it was wrong. Deploying locally from VSCode though I had things working, and so using the "Azure" tab in VSCode (no idea how to do this in the portal) I browsed the function app after a successful local deploy to peep the structure of the folder. Screenshot below. Your end state must be Python packages from your requirements file installed to a `.python_packages` folder in the root, and all other files in the root. I think you could get away with a folder such as `shared_code` to reference modules, but I was having issues with that. This was all with V2 of Python Azure Functions.

### Launch File

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Attach to Python Functions",
            "type": "debugpy",
            "request": "attach",
            "connect": {
                "host": "localhost",
                "port": 9091
            },
            "preLaunchTask": "func: host start"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Outscraper Response Format

For testing Outscraper webhooks locally. The `results_location` expires after 24 hours or so. To get a new one, go to the Outscraper portal, make a Google Maps API reviews request, and then go to <https://app.outscraper.com/api-usage> to get the `results_location`.

```json
{
    "id": "your-request-id",
    "user_id": "your-user-id",
    "status": "SUCCESS",
    "api_task": true,
    "results_location": "https://api.app.outscraper.com/requests/YXV0aDB8NjNhMzRkZGRjNmRmNDM5MGJmM2ZkMzZjLDIwMjQwODE3MjA1OTM1eHM0YQ",
    "quota_usage": [
        {
            "product_name": "Google Maps Data",
            "quantity": 1
        }
    ]
}
```
