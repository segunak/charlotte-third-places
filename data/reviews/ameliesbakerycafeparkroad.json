The quiche tastes like water from being frozen and reheated. I could peel the hard cold cheese off of my quiche. The cinnamon roll, don't bother it is dry and has very little cinnamon gooeyness. The eggs were boxed eggs and spongy, and they were also precooked. They were sent back with the cold bacon that is also pre made ahead . They came back now brown from the turbo oven. If you can't pul off simple eggs and bacon, why offer it? The cappuccino were good once we figured out the server doesn't bring them to you. Why am I tipping ? I have to clear my own plates and you can't bring me my coffee & food? The kicker is when I spoke to the brunette female  at the counter  that I was told was the Mgr on duty at 12:30pm this day didn't care at all. Just let us walk out after explaining to her about our experience.  I know as an f&b Mgr myself you do everything to make the customer happy. She failed and should probably be retrained on basic customer service."

If you pre-make the quiche, at least heat it up properly. The cheese on top was so hard and cold it just peeled off. I ordered the brioche french toast with scrambled eggs and bacon on the side. French toast was plain without any flavor besides the Syrup. But the biggest disappointment was the bacon and scrambled eggs. I mean pre-made bacon and eggs? My bacon and eggs both came cold, so I gave them back, asking for fresh made bacon and eggs, and I got pre- headed bacon and eggs again. They were brown and crispy For $35 I would expect at least fresh made bacon and eggs. Even Waffel House makes these two items fresh. Maybe come back for a coffee, but definitely not for the food."

            "review_text": "Came here TWICE this past week because the parents were in town and recently discovered Amelie's. We really enjoyed both visits!  The Good: first, the ambience is super cute! Kind of reminds me of an antique shop with French flair. As for the food, we all really enjoyed everything we tried. We tried several macaroons and multiple tarts. The tarts were the MVPs as they were delicious and not too sweet. The macaroons were also really good but were too sweet for all of us (none of us eat much sugar so we're all probably too sensitive to it). We also got some crustless quiches and chicken salad on croissant. My favorite was the chicken salad sandwich. The chicken wasn't fatty or gristly and seemed to be all white meat, which is my preference. The croissant was also insanely delicious and not stale as other reviews have mentioned. In fact, all of our pastries and food both times seemed to be really fresh.  The Meh: service wasn't the friendliest (except for the super nice lady who brought out our food - she was awesome). The ordering structure is confusing for newbies (see below) and I felt like the people working the pastry counter were impatient with us. There's a lot to look at within the pastry area and it may take some time to decide. They weren't busy when we came shortly after opening but I felt rushed making a decision on pastries.  The Bad: if you're new to Amelie's the ordering structure/process isn't clear and is confusing. One person takes pastry only orders and if you want anything else besides something in the pastry case, you have to place that order with a different person at the register. I get it but clear direction and patience would be appreciated. Apparently, if you order coffee, that comes out in the coffee bar area and not with your food. I think they call your name when your coffee order is ready but, due to the acoustics of the restaurant, I didn't hear a thing. Eventually, after I was almost done with my meal, I went in search for my latte and it was sitting on the counter. It would have been better if the cashier had let us know to watch out for our name or coffee at the coffee bar but I expected it to come out with my food. Like I said, I understand the structure of the food, pastry, coffee areas but staff were not helpful in communicating the process.  Overall, we really enjoy the food and the ambience so we will definitely be back when my parents come back!"

If it were not for decent pastries and good coffee, a zero star rating would be more accurate. However, the pastries are seriously over priced.  Amelies is not a good choice for those who only want coffee. The set up forces all customers to wait in what can be a very long and very slow moving pastry counter line. Even though there is potential for their second register to allow a separate coffee service line enabling better service to all customers, management refuses to implement this.  A friend I was with today wanted to bring this up again to the manager on duty and was met with obnoxious rudeness and unprofessionalism. The manager stated in a snarky tone that ‚Äúit is what it is and that there was a Starbucks up the road if he didnt like it.‚Äù I was shocked that a manger would act this way.  We took the managers suggestion and left. They lost 4 customers today. I will not give them my business ever again."

I've never seen dark meat in chicken salad and while I'm certainly not a professional chef , it just doesn't work. Not to mention there were bones in the chicken salad. My croque  Monsieur was decent. The tea for being in the south needs to be sweeter. Staff were sort of friendly. Sorry that was just the experience we had."

The croissants have no flavor and do not have crispy crusts, and their cakes likewise just taste like sugary bread. There's also a lack of consistency between the stores. :(  Update from 3 years ago: The Park Rd. location pleasantly surprised today. The pastries (petit gateau and eclair) were moist, flavorful and robust. Delicious!"

I ordered a sandwich and they put Mayo. I was already long gone.I came in today to get a quiche and the cafe marcotter. The coffee loses its taste halfway  and the quiche on the outside was really dry. However I liked how it tasted on the inside. The lady that gave me my order did not give me straws and didn't notice until I was at my car. I had to walk all the way back to the store. When people get drinks, you got to give them the straws. Whatever.  This specific location Im going to have to stop going to.  Maybe the other locations are better.  Where this place located is very weird. The first time I went to this place, I got lost. How about you all try being in the front of the area, or find a better location."

The soup was basically broccoli with hot water. No cheesy flavor, and only one piece of chicken in the whole soup. The chicken salad was not that great either.

Both the bride and I not being fans of cake elected to serve assorted desserts, and chose Amelie's based upon our past experiences ordering at the chain and their reputation. The bride and I love creme brulee and placed special significance on an individual serving that we were to \"tap\" simultaneously to break the crust. We ordered, paid and tipped days in advance and expected the tray of assorted desserts and a vanilla creme brulee to be ready. Upon pick up we learned first that Amelie's had not made our vanilla creme brulee that day and that they only had chocolate. I was flexible and agreed that we would take a chocolate instead, however they were also running out of the supply of the chocolate. While the staff presented their issue, the last creme brulee was served to another customer. The worst part was, I saw it walk out the door. The staff that day first failed to fulfill a pre-paid catering order, they failed to hold a product to the side to be received by a prepaying customer, and they failed to notify us of any issue in advance of pick up. Look, if you want a quick cup of coffee or an afternoon snack, Amelie's can adequately meet those needs, but in the case of catering they fall flat on their face. Their lack of oversight and accountability eliminated what was to be a special moment between my bride and I, a moment that we cannot get back."

The variety and quality of their coffee is probably the feature that keeps most folks coming back again and again, but if you try the pastries, you're in for a real treat. See pics.

However, I'm never overly impressed with their desserts. I ordered the Napoleon and it was still so frozen that I wasn't able to cut through it. The salted caramel brownie has way too much salt (at least more than I've ever had in a salted caramel brown) in comparison to the actual brownie part of the dish. The fruit tart doesn't have the same crumbly, firm crust like the tarts I've eaten in France, but it was still a nice treat."

The ratio of ingredients was spot on and the bacon perfectly crisp. Croissant was fluffy, flaky and buttery. Turkey was fresh and flavorful. The lettuce and spinach was fresh and crisp. And always love their herb Mayo. My mother got the same and she was just as pleased. She got a cinnamon espresso and loved it. Sweet but not too much. I got the chai hot drink and was pleasantly surprised, not too sweet at all and wonderfully spicy. We got a variety of pastries to go and was pleased with the variety to choose from. My only wish is that they weren't always out of the Napoleon (a favorite of mine). A good experience and the staff were attentive, lighthearted and friendly."

My friend ordered the creme br√ªl√©e, macaroons, and a americano. We sat and talked for hours. The ambience was great because we saw students studying, elderly women enjoying their cup of coffee, dressed up people as if they were going to an important event. This place welcomes everything. The art was fun and the decoration gave this place life. I highly recommend it and I will be going back to this delicious bakery and cafe, soon."

For my father's 50th birthday, I decided to order a cake hoping it would not disappoint! I went in on Wednesday evening; August 28th and was able to create a cake for pick up on Sunday, September 1st. I was quite happy they were able to complete it in such small timing. When I arrived to pick it up the lady asked for me to open it up and make sure it looked correct; it was and very tasty looking! After we finished lunch we dove into dessert. All of us super excited to try the cake and after the first bite; disappointment struck.. It was so dry and not even the mousse layers, frosting, or chocolate ganache could help (the best part was the chocolate ganache). It seemed like we had a cake that was made that night (Wednesday) and sat in the fridge for 4 days.. We ended up throwing the entire cake away. Do not order a custom cake - only enjoy their desserts from the counter!!"

Sadly, the only thing I liked (and I tried many items) was the palmier. The peach stuffed croissant was too heavy and saturating. The banana split cake was not a cohesive dessert- I only tasted banana and nothing else! My partner only tasted raspberry- basically the ingredients didn't come together- it was odd to say the least. The sticky bun was horrible tasting. The salted caramel brownie was a joke as we neither tasted any caramel nor salt. The chocolate ganache was below average. The Napoleon was interesting but not something I would eat again. The savory dishes were even worse, if you can believe it! The quiche had burnt crust, it was not light and fluffy as one would expect. We also ordered a tartine with fig, bacon and Brie. When we got the plate, we saw no figs, after taking a bite or two, we realized that they had applied fig jam very sparingly on the bread! The bacon was over cooked - some were burnt! They put so little brie that I didn't even taste it. And to top it all, the hot chocolate was not even hot! I will not do the mistake of going there again!"

Their beverage selection is quite expensive as well, serving different tees and coffees as well as alcoholic beverages too. Amelie's is a great place to have a coffee date with a friend or a group, or also to have quiet time in solitude and even study as there's a section of the floor with ample electric outlets for charging laptops. This Amelie's hosts a ambience with tasteful interior decor similar to its original NoDa location! Highly recommend!"

She was instantly rude and very unhelpful. I decided to stand by the register and saw my to-go bag behind the counter. The barista then yells at me \"You're going to have to wait in line like everyone else.\" I then told her my bag is right there and completely paid for and she then turned away. I work in retail, there is ABSOLUTELY no reason to speak with anyone that way. If you wake up on the wrong side of the bed that morning, there's no reason it needs to be taken out on any customer. I am so disappointed in my experience and will not be eating at Amelies anymore."

We had dinner at the backlot so we decided to walk over for some dessert.  It's a pretty nice space. It's pretty big and very open. There's a patio outside, but there's no food or drink allowed out there which is interesting.  We got a few macarons (birthday cake, caramel apple, and smores), a pumpkin macaron ice cream sandwich, and a spiced pumpkin and cream cheese entrement. Everything was delicious, but the ice cream sandwich was my favorite!  If you've never been to Amelie's before, it's definitely a must try!"

So flaky, buttery (the tomato skins made the sandwich a little messy and hard to eat, but I'm not splitting hairs). My wife got some kind of salted caramel brownie that was just great. And the coffee was spot on. Plenty of space to spread out, take in the hilarious Van Gogh with ear bandage and all, and just enjoy something decadent with friends, family, or a good book. Highly recommend."

You can even sit up over looking the pasty case.. recommend it if you plan on making another trip through the line.. I went around 10 am and there were no links but plenty of people..

Lots of space, speedy service (compared to NODA location), good selection of yummy baked goods and a few sandwich selections.  Reasonable pricing and friendly staff!  Today I chose the Key Lime Tart and a Salted Caramel Brownie both were good!  I tried a Caramel latte which was OK and the Creme Chai hot drink which was not hot and lacking flavor - it reminded me of instant mix... other than that, I like this place."
