I really try not to order from this location unless I'm running behind due to I have to pass this establishment daily to get to my business. The barista's at this location lack empathy and customer service. This was my last time coming here and I'm not surprised that when I came to write a review they only have 3 stars that speaks volumes right there. I spoke with the manager and explained what was wrong with my drink and the only explanation she could provide was oh we're trying to come back from Covid not how may I fix the issue. I ordered the strawberry Açaí with extra sugar. They left out the dry strawberries but when I went it other drinks were being prepared with them for me to be told oh I just opened those. Excuse me ma'am did you not think to open them early on when you see you were running out. The drink is was very watery with lemonade added. Skip this location if you can that's all I will say."

I hope the corporate office knows that she portrays such horrible customer service and literally doesn't serve customers.

From what I saw the folks that work there do a fantastic job in a very high stress/volume situation. Even so, this will be my first and last visit to this store due to an extremely unpleasant experience I had there with my family on a cold pre Christmas evening.  My daughter was home from school and we stopped into this Starbucks store for a warm drink and to catch up. Our drinks were perfect and we went upstairs to get away from the draft that blew when the doors opened.  There was an older masked man sitting at the corner table hidden behind a backpack and open laptop on his table that stared at me menacingly as I took a table by the window out of his view. My daughter came up behind me and said that he stared at her with both middle fingers straight up. I thought nothing of it and we started chatting. At one point he walked into my view to peer over the railing down stairs. He kept shaking his hand at me as if to shoo us away. That caught my attention! When we finished and were preparing to leave, he glared at us and again raised his middle finger. I asked him from across the room what he was doing and he said with a sneer “F@&K YOU”! With my family there I did not want to engage any further so we quickly went downstairs to speak to the staff. They described him and unapologetically said they knew exactly who he was. The whole time he glared down at us from upstairs. We got the feeling that at this Starbucks store it was accepted that an abusive obscene masked man owns the upstairs lounge and it was not a family oriented store so we left. As we walked to our cars he continued his one finger salute from the upstairs window near the table we were just sitting at. Both my wife and daughter -who are avid Starbucks customers- said they were glad I was there or they would have not felt safe and further said they would not return either."

I thought I could at least make it to the Starbucks drive through without breaking down but as soon as I pulled up the window and saw the pictures of the dogs I immediately broke down.  The woman at the window was so kind, told me she was so sorry and asked how she could help, and gave me a couple of gift cards.  I know that seems like not a big deal but to me on that day it meant everything.  I actually went in there in person for first time today and every single employee greeted me and asked how I was.  I'm with my children full time so I don't go too many places alone these days but this will forever be my go to spot when I need some peace (and some great service).  Thank you!"

When they are open it only seems to be the drive-thru, which is already poorly designed and causes traffic to backup. I now only go to this location if I am absolutely desperate for coffee.

The owners (franchisee I am sure) don't seem to care about the negative reviews. If I had to guess, I would say they are \"closed\" so that they can cut back on payroll yet maximize drive through revenue right now before the tax year ends in order to make some big savings at the employees and customers expense. Boycott this store and head to the Starbucks on Carmel road (1 mile away down Sharon road in the Harris Teeter shopping center), that store is OPEN, and FRIENDLY. Far superior.

I parked and walked up to the \"Mobile Pickup\" window (door with table in front of it). I stood there for several minutes (3 to 4) while watching 3 employees standing behind the counter talking. There was one girl working making coffee and managing the drive through window. Finally one of the talkers noticed me and asked \"can I help you with something?\" I responded I had a mobile order. She said it's coming, and I watched her pull several labels off the printer and put them on cups, one of these was my beverage (I noticed the Splenda packets) and she finished making my drink made a couple of others and then brought me mine. On my way back to my car I noticed the drive through line was longer and the car that pulled in behind me had not made it to the menu/order board. Long story, if you want to wait a long time for a mediocre cup of coffee then by all means go to this location, if you want good service and a good cup of coffee go to the Starbucks at Park Towne Village!"

Then i still didnt get my drink. Then a women by the name aysa vame out laughing playing and jokes like she didnt see the line then it took another 5 to 6 minutes to get my drink they joking and playing i told the manager and he said he was going to say something to them he never did.

The very sweet and observation young man that stepped up to the counter seeing the growing line (he's new and the best service I've received here) was taking the trash out, starting taking order without washing his hands.  Proceeded to grab my cup for my drip coffee near the lip.  Lastly, much attention doesn't appear to go into ensuring the customer prep station is filled and trying to get someone's attention behind the counter for more sugar, creamer or stirrers is much like waiting to place an order.... the employees don't acknowledge your presence."

Not sure if she is a manager or not but she had a black apron, short hair in a hat, and headset on. She was VERY RUDE. She literally just handed us the order. Didn't speak and when we asked if this was all of it she said “yep” and started to walk away. We said “oh ok well you have a good day too!” Jessie literally threw up a “peace sign” ✌🏼 I mean really?! Once we looked through our stuff one of the drinks was totally wrong. Had to go back inside and get it corrected. Brianna again was super sweet. Once we made it back to work, we realized that ANOTHER drink order was wrong!!! We've tried to call this location over and over and nobody answers. Our entire office is extremely disappointed with this Starbucks location and won't be returning. We will be going out of our way to go to another location for better service and correct orders!! Even my 8 year old noticed how rude Jessie was! That's sad."
