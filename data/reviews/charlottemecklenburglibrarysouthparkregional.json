I came home but the branch manager failed to call me and did NOT EVEN cross check the situation that day and emaiped me SIMPLY went with a stupid fact that I moved to home from Charlotte to Matthews, so, should not come to this library?! I believe this is NOT Charlotte Mecklenburg public library POLICY RULE, otherwise, you should have practice and enact the same to every single library users(patrons/visitors/community residents) including former and current residents. This won't apply to visitors though especially when a person offend/attack/antagonistically threatened against another (benign/mindful) person CLEARLY."

It even has a \"teens\" area (where I spend most of my time), which is likely the quietest place in the library. That's very helpful as a high schooler, especially one that gets distracted easily. Plenty of seating throughout the library, so far have never had trouble finding somewhere to sit and do work."
