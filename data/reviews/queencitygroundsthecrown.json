Flat white was excellent, syrups and sauces are made in-house. A smile üòä would have been the icing on the experience, especially since there was a ‚Äúbe right back‚Äù sign greeting me upon arrival, but we all have bad days sometimes. Love the small selection of gourmet foods from honeys to pasta and sauce."

Definitely recommend this place to those seeking the taste and flavor of real freshly roasted and ground coffee.

What I got was amazingly strong and flavorful, almost forgotten sensation. Definitely will be my fuel stop before work."
