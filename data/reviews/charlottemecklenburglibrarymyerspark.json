Thanks to the fast wifi I was able to quickly jump between multiple tabs, play video and post. While I was working I could barely hear some of the locals communicating with the librarians and I could tell based on their tones that both were smiling. Quick answers were given when a member asked how to find a DVD. Good workspaces, friendly staff and best of all Great room for parents and children to enjoy a good book together!"

Kids are not expected to just sit in one area but can dance and walk around the room during the story time time.  One very negative aspect would be when I witnessed a librarian asking a Mother to go take her child for a walk because the baby was crying. The mother and child were in the children's area and the baby was doing what normal babies do it. The mother was very flustered and ended up just leaving the library. Things like this I find to be unacceptable, and hopefully it is not something that happens often"

Came to study but between the employees and patrons at the desk talking in normal tone and slamming what sound like a cash drawer as they work to the 2 fire trucks that have passed by within the hour that I've been here. Study cubes are right by the window so you hear any traffic noise that goes by. I can also hear someone over in the kid section narrating to the kids and playing music and the 2 people having a full conversation in the book aisle."

I love coming here just to read the paper or check out a late best seller before walking over to Harris Teeter to grab a few items for dinner. One of the best treasures of Charlotte's wonderful Myers Park neighborhood."
