Sara made me an excellent Sea Salt Caramel Oat Milk Latte but then she and I got to talking and I did something I never do, ordered a second coffee just to try it. Come in ready for that type of experience!  They work with Crown Town compost, who picks up their waste weekly. Sara tells me that coffee shops can compost virtually everything, which was great to learn. They are eco friendly and offer a host of alternative milks. Their beans are locally roasted and the pastries are baked in Charlotte as well.  They have two locations in Charlotte and I'm sorry to only be able to visit one. Next visit it will be on my list."
