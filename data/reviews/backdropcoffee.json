Not only are the staff and owners nice the food and coffee is insanely good. I ordered the sourdough waffles with bananas, housemade flavored whip cream and honey but will be back for the avocado toast..  While here, i experienced my first coffee batching (coffee tasting) and never realized how freshly roasted and ground beans could taste different depending upon the region.  if you are looking for a great locally owned coffee shop and want to expand your knowledge of coffee I'd highly suggest Backdrop Coffee] because they have a passion for coffee and it shows.  5 out of 5 from me... I had such a great experience here."

The owners are focused on making a difference in the world and are dedicated to inclusive spaces for those who are differently-abled (many of their employees have disabilities and do everything from roasting to making the artwork). They provide a sensory coffee tasting experience, complete with lights, sounds, and tactile objects. I've never seen anything like it. Positivity radiates through the place - not to mention the coffee and treats are delicious on top of everything else. This is a MUST visit!"

The energy in the shop is wonderful and they work hard to be inclusive in their hiring process at every level.  The story behind all of their artwork is lovely and I recommend asking about it while you're there.  Everything from paintings to the art on their coffee beans to the rugs in the shop have a story.  My roommate and I were lucky enough to get a tour and all I can say is that we will definitely be back often.  It's a truly wonderful place and I'm excited about seeing it in all its glory when it has a public grand opening.  OH and the event space in the back!  It has a pretty fantastic view and has so much space that if you're looking for an awesome space to rent for a venue I highly recommend contacting the owners of Backdrop!"
