They have incredible coffee, cold brew, oat milk, vegan items, a brand new seasonal menu, 16 beers on tap, a fantastic cocktail program, kombucha, cider beers, desserts, games, TV's, chill couches, private office space, literally could go on. It's a great spot for meetings, interviews, hanging with friends and they have live music most Friday nights with food trucks. I can't say enough great things about this place and they are always adapting and adding new items based on poling their guests and residents. I heard they will be carrying fresh produce soon which will be very convenient. I come down some nights for a bottle of wine, grab a cocktail before I catch the light rail, or play pool with friends. The nice part is they are open until 9pm most nights! I highly recommend coming to check out their coffee, food and environment - it's a great location at the Scaleybark light rail station and currently have free garage and street parking!"

            "review_text": "As a resident who's been with LTH from it's birth at Novel, I have been incredibly disappointed and unsatisfied with what has become of this beautiful coffee shop. When it first opened, the staff was AWESOME and the vibe was unmatched. There was a sense of community, the staff was welcoming, actually cared about how you were doing and asked about where you'd been if they didn't see you for awhile. I actually knew staff NAMES and was excited to come see my friends who would always make me the most delicious cup of coffee. The staff before would see my boyfriend and I, waiting in line and by the time we'd get to the front, our order would already be waiting for us. Carlos, Mackenzie, Maggie, Deja and Tyler were the absolute best people that could've worked at that coffee shop. Now, there's new management. The menus for both coffee, drinks and food have changed. The prices are INSANE. $10 for a yogurt, $11 for a smoothie. And to top it off, the perks of being a resident have slowly dissipated (free refill on coffee with a special mug, 10% discount, etc). If you're willing to pay close to $8-$9 for a vanilla oat milk latte, this is your place. There is no sense of community anymore. A group of us, every Friday, would come to the coffee shop for Food Truck Fridays, listen to the amazing live music and have fun. Now, the place is DEAD on the weekends, there's no more food trucks or trivia. There's hardly ever live music and when there is, it's incredibly weird elevator music. The staff is not educated well enough to be serving cocktails - nor do they make the cocktails they used to have on the menu, even though they still have all of the ingredients for them. Everyone here is incredibly rude/stuck up, especially the new management. This place really was like a family. Now, this place will never have my business. I won't even go here out of desperation. Save your money and brew your own $6 bag of coffee from Harris Teeter. This place is not the vibe. BTW, my boyfriend was LITERALLY charged $1 EXTRA for getting a cold brew without ice…and was not given his 10% resident discount because after almost a year, they stopped honoring it.. Who does that?! Rude, greedy, way over priced, horrible customer service."

The atmosphere is definitely on point; natural lighting to die for with added accent lights. And even with the high ceiling (which I love) the background chatter is minimal, allowing for the music and the eloquent sounds of barista magic to shine through. Carlos is also a gem, fantastic customer service! I had a Caramanilla; one of their signature drinks, it was made perfectly. A well balance of coffee, milk, caramel and vanilla and not too sweet; which is perfect because I like to actually taste the coffee and not just a sugary hot drink."

Even after seeing I already took of my jacket and bookbag, and set up my laptop, he asked me if I wanted my order to go. And I sat next to the register and he didn't ask anyone else the entire 3 hours I was studying there if they wanted their orders to go. That made it indirectly very clear I was just not welcomed. I guess the barista don't like serving black people or something. Or was told to be rude to black customers, idk he was just not as friendly to me as everyone is saying in the reviews and to the other customers. Crazy thing is also, No one else seemed like they cared that a black college girl was on her laptop studying for classes except that barista. Also he did a weird hard look away from me when giving me my drink. I was none the less a paying customer studying. Not someone loitering and I tipped him, which I regret. So yeah I wouldn't come here if your black they are going to purposefully make you feel unwelcomed. And your going to regret giving them your money, like I did."

            "review_text": "THE BEST Coffee Shop in Charlotte, by far.  I came across this place while looking for an alternative to Starbucks & Caribou Coffee where I could have a clean, bright area to work and enjoy a coffee.  What I found was a much more than  a coffee shop-   this feels more like a modern restaurant/lounge.  First- the service is outstanding. Starting with Carlos, the team here is the best I have seen in a long time.  Maggie, Hazel and the team in the morning are very welcoming and accommodate almost any request for coffee/ food (e.g. I do not like Onions- so they made me a breakfast burrito without pico de gallo).  Other pluses:   The location is new, clean and modern.  Large windows create a well lit and bright environment.   The tall ceiling (2 floors) ensures that you can work here for an hour or two and avoid smelling like burnt coffee when you leave.  The music is appropriate but not overbearing like some other coffee shops.  Seating-  lots of seating- and comfortable seating.  Start to finish- my new place 100%.   Great quality product, great location and friendly intuitive service.   Excellent."

Friendly service, cool vibe, and really good drinks. In addition to the coffee cocktails, they have traditional coffee drinks, specialty coffee drinks, beer, and wine as well. They also have a nice selection of baked goods and snacks. Lots of casual activities around like pool, Jenga, tic tac toe, board and card games, etc. Definitely plan on going back."

Coming from, and being used to, the craft coffee culture in SoCal I was worried I wasn't going to be able to find comparable places in NC. Was I wrong! LTH coffee is delicious, the drinks are not too sweet (you can still taste the espresso!), and they've been getting more and more pastries in which is awesome!  I'd say I come here 4 days out of the week, just can't get enough! (Plus that they have a sweet co-working space and beer/wine on tap!)"
