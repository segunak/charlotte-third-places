The prices were what you would expect nowadays, but the serving size was surprisingly large. I got the chicken pita sandwich and it was a good sandwich, better than Panera for sure. BTW, their baklava was the best I've had in a while, definitely worth a try."

Their coffee is great, particularly their seasonal specials and lattes. Their cold brew is perfect and strong, particularly great when you have a big work day ahead of you. I recommend the avocado toast or yogurt bowl for breakfast/brunch (two of my favorites), and their Italian panini or avocado and turkey panini for lunch.  Their greek yogurt is some of the best that I have ever had. Their pastries are also outstanding. The staff is warm and kind and recognize familiar faces.  Great for staying and eating inside (or outside) with friends, or ordering pick up or a quick coffee and sandwich if you're on the run.  Has a dog friendly outside area with a water bowl and treats. 100% recommend! Love it."

The minute you walk in you are greeted by a wonderful team (mostly family) with a smile.  They offer Greek coffee which is brewed on sand and also iced Greek frappe and freddo cappuccino (my fave) as well as other Italian classics: espresso, lattes, etc.  I love that it is such a European atmosphere; besides Greeks, you'll find Serbians, Bosnians, Italians, Russians and others there enjoying.  Must Try: *Crepes (Savory & Sweet) my favorite is the Nutella and banana with Papadopoulo cookie crumbs!  *Spanakopita (no description necessary)  *Greek Yogurt with fresh fruits and honey  *Greek Salad  *\"The Vibe\" Ice Cream Sundae"

I went to this place based on a referral I received from the owner of Ilios Crafted Greek and I'm so glad I did! If you want an amazing Greek coffee (rather difficult to accomplish in my book), this place is a must. I had the Freddo Cappuccino which is a double iced espresso with frothed milk and it was absolutely amazing. The quality of coffee, richness of flavor and authentic Greek coffee taste makes it one of my new favorites. I plan to try the frappe next and then migrate to a few of the hot coffee options.  I went back for a second time to check out their food and was very pleasantly surprised. The turkey avocado panini is everything I would have expected with the perfect blend of seasoning and ingredients so every item of the sandwich could be tasted without one thing overwhelming the others. My colleague ordered the Greek Toast and said it too was perfect and exactly what he was hoping for.  We also ordered the sundae crepe which of I were on vacation, I would literally eat every day of the vacation. The cookie interior was perfect without being too much frosting or cookie. The crepe was perfectly fine and the gelato on top literally made it the perfect dessert for all ages. I will absolutely be back for more!  If you are looking for a place with amazing Greek coffee and delicious desserts while also serving great quality and healthy food (to justify The desserts and coffeeüòâ), I would highly recommend checking this place out! The desserts are definitely what is drawing most people along with the amazing Greek coffee, but with food that's delicious as well, it's worth adding to the list of spots to check out."

All the crepes, savory and sweet, were excellent. Next time, I have to try the waffles as they looked delicious when others ordered them. I have ordered almost every coffee on the menu.

We had the cucumber bites appetizer...my compliments to the creator of this dish!  Soooo good!  We also had the Mediterranean Pita and it was so fresh and tasty and not too heavy. The tzatziki spread was delicious.  My wife had the Apple Pecan salad and loved it.  Looking forward to tasting some of the desserts and authentic coffee. Give this place a try you won't be disappointed!!"
