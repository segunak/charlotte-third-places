Overall, poor attitude.. not asking for all smiles but like I'm asking for your help.. My drink was pretty bland and I was really disappointed. Wasn't sweet at all, nor taste like brown sugar. Simply tasted like black tea with milk. The tapioca bobas also were so soft, denigrating, tasted like nothing. Snot constancy really. I asked my friend about it and he said that's not how my drink should've tasted at all. Hopefully other people get treated better than I did. Really am sad about this first experience. Will try elsewhere instead of Queen City.."

The next person orders & he goes straight to the kitchen and starts preparing food. The icing on the cake for me was when he blew his nose & still didn't wash his hands. I haven't even gotten to him constantly scratching his arms. I asked who was in charge & told them of his nasty habits. He admitted to not washing his hands bc he put on gloves. THAT MEANS NOTHING IF YOUR HANDS WERE DIRTY WHEN YOU TOUCHED THEM! The young lady in charge made his wash his hands but the damage was done. I strongly suggest the owner review the cameras. It doesn't matter if it's his first job or not those are disgusting habits especially in the food industry."

            "review_text": "Cute set up. However, I would not recommend if you desire a nutritional smoothie with real fruits and vegetables. I've never heard of a smoothie place that doesn't serve a green smoothie.. there were no greens on site. Very telling. I watched the staff member make my smoothie and he literally was just scooping in what seemed to be flavored sugar or powdered versions of a banana or strawberry. I didn't see actual strawberries go into the smoothie, it was this like jelly substance. No real fresh food for actual nourishment. I think their use of the term smoothie is misleading. It was so much sugar it gave my mom a headache. Thank goodness I stayed to watch them make the smoothie. I asked for oat milk and if I wasn't standing there the young man would have given me whole milk which could be a major issue for someone who is plant based or vegan. I had turned away for a second and when I turned back I saw he was filling the smoothie with the red cap milk, which is whole milk. He had to do the smoothie over. The unfortunate part is that folks would order this, thinking they are doing good by ordering a smoothie and they're really just getting flavoring, sugar, and whole milk. Not okay. Giving two stars because the two staff members were sweet and gentle. They're just trying to do their job so this review is not a reflection of them but rather the owner's business strategy on using the term smoothie as a buzz term but feeding people junk. That's not okay."

Many places have soy (which I stay away from personally) and Almond milk as the only dairy free options. Almond milk it's not good to me in boba. It lacks the creaminess that oat milk and coconut milk have. They do update their UberEats menu whenever they run out.  Anyway, I ordered Taro Milk Tea, Hazelnut Tea and Cajun Fries (w/ honey mustard). I swear the Taro was sooooooooooo good. I almost ordered another one. Also, I don't know where they get their honey mustard but that thing is Crack. So good! Best Cajun fries I've had. Lastly, they have way more boba options than most places like Cherry Bloom Boba. So unique!  I took away 1 star because they don't have BROWN SUGAR BOBA."

I always get the same here which is the Almond Milk Tea with 80% sugar and regular ice with extra pearls. My favorite part of ordering bubble tea is that you can choose your ice levels and sweetness. So for anyone who is new to the Boba Tea scene don't feel too pressured but you have the options of choosing toppings, sweetness levels and ice levels! Every time I come up to Charlotte I choose this place. Highly recommend their food and drinks here."

Matcha boba, crystal boba, classic tapioca black pearls and aloe for my friends that like tea but not boba pearls so much. I also do enjoy the food a lot.  The fries and the cauliflower was so yum.  There is a parking lot which is a plus.  Makes it so easy to visit.  I do wish they'd do better about the timing when it comes to giving someone tea and there hot food as stated in my previous review.  But I had to update this review since I have been away from this place and just miss it so much.  --------------------------- Previous Review They will bring food out before tea is ready. So if you're grabbing and going, your food will be cold. I asked about it and they said there's nothing they can do. When they could easily either hurry up the drink order or just wait to cook until after the drink is done. So dumb."

I was looking forward to trying something different but I should've just gone to my regular boba place. When I arrived I was the only customer in the shop. After ordering, it literally took them 15 min to make 2 drinks. I'm not sure what it was but one employee me it and the other one just stood around instead of helping.

We'll have to try the other flavors and the small bites next time!  Update: came back and got their food combo. 6 wings + tea for $9.55 (basically just an extra $1.60 for the tea)! Also tried the spicy fried cauliflower bites for $4.50. Everything was delicious. The drums were extra big, and the cauliflower bites were crispy and had a nice kick."

Apparently we are the only ones who didn't know how awesome this place was. We are there at 2:30 on a Sunday and it was pretty crowded.  The service was great. They were happy to offer recommendations. They also let us sample one of the milk teas and told us they would remake our drinks if we didn't like something.  We ended up getting a honey green milk tea with cheese cream and boba along with a taro milk tea with sea salt cream and boba. Both were really good. I preferred the cheese cream top over the sea salt cream.  We also tried their popcorn chicken. We got one with sweet chili and one with Korean BBQ sauce. I preferred the Korean BBQ sauce. The chicken didn't even need sauce though. It was very tender and flavorful. We got one with waffle fries and one when Cajun fries. Both fries were delicious.  We'll definitely be back here considering how good it was and how convenient the location is for us."

The regular flavoring is salt and pepper, but you do have the option to make it a bit spicy. The fries are delicious too. My go-to favorite is the sweet potato fries. The only downside is it gets soggy fast."

Sure it was tasty, but definitely not worth over $3, or my being late to my appointment nearby. I went there on a whim as I had an appointment at 4:00 in the nearby office park. I got there about 3:40. I was fourth in line, as the group of three ahead of me had just ordered and sat down. I don't like to have caffeine that late, so I asked what options were caffeine free. There weren't many. So I got the lemonade. Figured it would be easy. Added a dollar for tip, bringing my total for a (maybe) 20oz cup of lemonade to $7.44. Far , far, too expensive. But the kid and straw were very nice, so I guess I was paying for those. The girl at the register seemed to be working hard, and there was another woman making food in the back. However it didn't seem as though the place was set up for efficiency."

This time around I decided to try something new: taro milk tea. Never had taro or taro-flavored anything, but I've heard raves about it. Wow is all I can say! Addict at first sip. I love the variety of toppings you can add for an extra 50 cents. I went with the grass jelly topping and it was the perfect combination. I also ordered the spicy cauliflower wings. Delish! My sister ordered the peach milk tea with lychee toppings, and she loved it. I'm definitely coming back next time to get the Queen City-sized cup!"
