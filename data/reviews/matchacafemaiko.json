It was not a nice combo and I would highly recommend ordering the toast with no cream!!! I would really consider revising this menu item… Absolutely no one orders an avocado toast wanting a dessert.

It's not much more expensive than starbucks, and twice at good as the matcha they offer. I enjoyed the americano too, though next time I will probably order an extra shot. My only critique would be that the booth seating is a bit uncomfortable, thought I am on the taller side so also need more leg room haha. I enjoyed sitting outside though, the shaded seating was very comfortable. The atmosphere definitely made up for the booth as well. Definitely returning to treat myself."

I would make the argument these are the best matcha products I've ever had, period (and I've had quite a few in different cities and states). Absolutely worth it if you love matcha as much as I do."

I can guarantee that this special experience will make you say \"I love matcha so matcha!\" after finishing your first dessert. I normally get their matcha soft serve, but you also can't go wrong with their other desserts and drinks on their menu.  DESSERT 1: Golden Shogun ($9.50) - This is the ultimate flex move. A soft-serve flavor of your choice (matcha, hojicha, seasonal) topped off with a 24k edible gold sheet in a waffle cone will make you feel like a millionaire. The matcha flavor is present, but it's definitely not one of the strongest I've tasted. I've made stronger matcha milkshakes at home.  WORTH IT? YES, it's worth it for the experience and whenever you're in town (Overall 7/10)"

It's one of the very few places that actually has ube soft-served ice cream, which is a Filipino purple yam and is in a majority of Filipino desserts.  Service: Friendly and attentive staff.  Environment: The cafe is very well-designed with chic, rustic decor. I love all the color details, backsplashes, free formed wooden table, and even the mermaid floor tiles in the bathroom. There are two black benches and a front seating area with patio chairs and two tables outside. The entryway has 4-5 bar seatings, and a couple of tables inside. It was our first time in this retail area. If you walk behind the building, there's a small lake full of geese and ducks. You can walk around the lake and it has a lot of bench seats. There was also a boba tea place in the same area.  Food: We got the matcha and ube soft serve, on a waffle cone, which was super creamy and delicious. My husband got their matcha tiramisu, which they prepared when we ordered. I found out that they also have milk bread toast with various toppings. It looks like a super, fluffy French toast. I'll have to try it next time. They have that with avocado toppings, banana nutella, berries, and kinako mochi. They serve floats, coffee, teas, frappes, and other baked goods, too."

I already had a stressful day because I feared the worst before my dentist appointment, but my visit here turn that all around. The employees were very sweet and welcoming. I decided to go for a con of their Matcha soft serve and it was the best Matcha ice cream I've ever tasted. The soft serve is equal parts sweet with just the perfect amount of bitterness. I will definitely be back and bringing my friends because this was amazing and turn my day around."

My wife loves the straight Matcha, and my mother the black sesame. At the end of the day, each of us could eat any flavor but we still have our favorites.

They had us sample all their ice cream flavors and I loved hojicha and black sesame. It was the first time I've seen either of these in Charlotte.  We decided to get the Maiko Special with a vanilla hojicha ice cream swirl. Overall, I loved it. It had a matcha cake in it that I actually liked. It also had a special matcha ice cream in it which I really didn't like, but was able to avoid.  They use the same waffle cones as Jeni's which I love. I tried some of my friends black sesame waffle cone which was great.  Warning: the hojicha and matcha products have caffeine in them. It makes sense if you think about it but I forgot since I was just eating dessert and it kept me up half the night (I don't drink caffeine).  The decor is really well done. The service is incredibly friendly. I will be back (but will probably stick to black sesame next time to avoid the caffeine)!"

They also have milder creamy matcha for those who aren't as big a fan of stronger bitter matcha. The hojicha (roasted green tea) is good too for those who want a nuttier taste to their matcha. The parfait was my favorite, everything is home made in the shop including the mochi they used for the parfait and waffles for the cones. The owner was extremely nice and helpful when we came in. Would recommend highly if you are in the area."
