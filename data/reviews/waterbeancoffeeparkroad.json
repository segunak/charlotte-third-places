Further, being suggested to not get certain orders, because \"there are a lot of people ahead of you\" isn't exactly a good sign. We took their advice and ordered iced coffee (apparently \"famous\") but it still took over 15 minutes to be made. Not worth the wait. Finally, they sell macarons. The options are $2.35 individually, or, \"to save a few bucks,\" a box of 5 for $12.50. I'll let you use your phone calculator to figure out the savings. TL;DR Starbucks is 300 meters up the street. EDIT: Spoke to my wife, the wait was 20-25 minutes, not 15. My bad."
