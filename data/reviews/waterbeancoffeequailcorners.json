Plenty of seating and outlets at every table. Great customer service. Nice set of food options for breakfast/lunch, and not just pastries/break - there are hot and cold sandwiches, at least one of which is veggie. Clean restroom. Convenient location with plenty of parking in the Quail Corners shopping center. Try the coffee with that awesome little chocolate bean, as well as the various tea options which you can sample by scent right there at the counter. It's clean. Apple Pay. The music playlist sounds a lot like my own personal playlist (as of Oct 2022) - Cleo Sol, Solange, Pip Millett, etc. Well-played on all angles, Waterbean. WELL-PLAYED."

A wide selection of single-origin and blended coffee selections. I was looking for a bean to buy to do home espresso with. Fortunately for me, they offer an \"Espresso Flight,\" three different espresso shots for when you can't make up your mind. The two baristas were very welcoming and knowledgeable, giving their opinions on the various beans, sharing their preferences and how/what they brew at home, to help me find the right choice. And when they brewed espressos, going from one coffee to another, they took the time to make sure to dial it in right to present a quality drink, well-worth the time and money."
