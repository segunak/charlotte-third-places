The Whole Foods at Southpark is the WORST WF's location and supermarket  I have ever shopped at. Is understocked, disorganized and the personnel is arrogant and don't condescending. The bread section is poor, little variety and the few fresh breads they bake are always out. The penut butter machine is always empty and if you request for it to be filled, no peanuts and they look at you as you are NUTS. Produce during Thanksgiving was old. I could go on forever..simply, pathetic location staffed with entitled employees."

It was close to closing so I didn't want them to have to make more pizza, so I said I would take the Equivalent slices of what they had left. Normal person wasn't there so I was told I could, and it would be charged as a whole pizza (about $17-$18). Before the person filling in handed it to me, pizza guy cam back and said they can't do that and said it would actually about $6 more and would be charged as individual slices.

Yesterday I was in this store and again I bought bell peppers for $2.99 ​​but at the checkout it was already $3.49!!!  instead of going to the car, I went to the customer service and spent my time there.  I've been trying to solve this problem for two months now, but nothing works out, they blatantly lie and hypocrite in your eyes, and no one does anything.  Maybe whole foods makes a profit this way, I would not like to believe in it.  There is a saying A fish rots from the head.

You wouldn't think that a grocery store is an excellent place to hang out, but this Whole Food is a staple for many.  As a grocery store it is very clean, organized, and has high quality products. For daily shopping I find it to be too expensive and would really only shop there to get specialty items like vegan or vegetarian supplements. The wine and beer selection is decent, but other stores have a bigger selection. The staff has always been friendly and helpful which I appreciate. The bar keep is always on point too which helps."

The store is very clean and the shelves are very neat. I also find some of the brands interesting because I have never seen them before and I try them out sometimes. I am learning to venture out more and open up my world a little bit. I shop at Aldi for the big bulk paper products, meats, fish, fruits and vegetables. When I need to get something specific I can always find it at Harris Teeter or Compare. I am originally from NY and have been here over a year now. What I find interesting about Whole Foods is the interaction with the staff. Half the staff is nice and friendly and customer centric. If you are looking for a product they will let you know where it is located, if they changed it to another aisle, or if they are out and what stores near-by may carry it. I find this is a plus because it is a sign of a good company and a well trained staff. The other half looks annoyed to be there, and act like they are suffering through some kind of punishment. Sometimes I look at them in the eyes and they avoid any kind of interaction. A simple and friendly hello would be enough for me. This is what I call a friendly light place and maybe it is a Charlotte thing. They are polite but they really don't want any kind of interaction with other people. I get it because that is how NY people are. We are are always in a rush to catch a train, bus, or cab to and from work and the people that get in our way are just annoying. I know this is a rough job market, but why on earth would you take a job dealing directly with the public if you don't really enjoy being around people."

I went to the cheese section looking for an item and two young ladies were working behind the counter(s) and not one of them acknowledged me. I was  searching or looking  for at least five minutes and they continued chatting amongst themselves.. A  young caucasian male walks up and one of the ladies immediately asked him if he needed assistance and even came from behind the counter to assist him. My facial expression was noticeable, then I  was acknowledge. I did say to one of the young ladies,  that neither of them asked me if I needed help. She was apologetic and  the saleslady that was eager to help the male customer stated,  \"I'm sorry, I did not see you walk up.\" That is the wrong thing to say. That is what is said to all persons of color when they are not given fair customer service in the same situation.  These young ladies seem nice enough, and maybe it was not intentional, but they need to be mindful. Sadly,  that unfair treatment  amongst people of color happens way too often, and it is time for it to stop. People of color deserve the same customer service/ acknowledgement as non persons of color. We're spending  our money in the establishment too!"

We knew it  was designed for  four people; but, we figured the leftovers would be good through the weekend.  We were extremely disappointed in most respects. The mashed potatoes and dressing were inedible. They never made it to the table. God only knows how long they'd been sitting in their refrigerated containers; but, it left them in a very sorry state. The green beans and gravy were extremely under-seasoned, and the small, precooked turkey was so cold that it took over 2 hours to heat to the recommended temperature.  Throughout the experience, the phrase \"live and learn\" kept coming up for me. On this, the day after, it's been replaced by \"never again.\""

If this is a policy Whole Foods is adopting regarding their food/hot bar and other food sections, it should be made much more widely known and aware to the public and customers. And of course the staff there exhibited no sign of emotion or care to even explain to us what's available and what's not available. Extremely disappointing and cold environment.  EDIT: After having reached out to Whole Foods and settling this issue with them, I can speak to the great deal of quality customer service this store strives for. Not only was I explained the situation in a well-rounded matter as well as receiving empathy for my subpar experience, I was also given compensation for my troubles which was far and beyond my expectation. I'm happy to live near a grocery store that truly care about the community it serves."

The store has great curb appeal and it's very inviting. They have a wide selection of groceries and every department had something unique to offer. I was thoroughly impressed with the amount of seating this grocery store had. Never thought about sitting down at a grocery store to have a latte or slice of pizza until I came here. I also noticed that Amazon dropped alot of the prices here."

But their olive bar is what got me hooked. Their wild mushroom medley, sweet olives, artichokes are just so delicious!! Have I mentioned the picked okra also? Yum! The tres leches cake was excellent. Not sickly sweet but just right! The cookies are great too!"

            "review_text": "As far as Whole Foods go, this one is a cute little quaint location that packs a lot into a small space.  It is paid parking in the attached garage and has a nice indoor dining area as well as outdoor patio seating. They even have a little couch and cushy chair sitting area and a bar where you can order beers on tap and coffee.  They have a hot bar and sandwich bar and pizza by the slice as far as their eat-in or to-go food offerings go.  I didn't really grocery shop, but they have a decent, though small, beer & wine section. I was a little disappointed they don't offer bombers and their rose section was definitely lacking. Apparently, though, one of the employees said we weren't the first to complain about them not carrying bombers of beer and that he's petitioning store management to start off with a small area of them. So, Mgmnt, if you read these reviews, please look into carrying at least a small cache of high abv bombers #kthanks.  Another thing to keep in mind for this location is that it is located at the bottom of a newly constructed apt bldg and apparently they are having all kinds of construction issues that keep setting off the fire alarm. Sitting at the bar on a gorgeous, but hot, Saturday afternoon the alarm went off 3 bites into my slice of pizza and we were forced to evacuate the bldg...pizza & drink in hand (thank goodness I didn't order a beer like my date, which he had to leave in the store because we couldn't have it outside!). It took like 20mins before they started letting people back in and after talking to a regular who was standing outside w/us, this happens about once a week, if not more. My date decided to forfeit his beer (even though I told him that Whole Foods totally owed him a new one, but he didn't want to bother) so we could continue w/our day as I had finished my pizza while standing outside, uncomfortably in the heat.  Needless to say, I won't be coming back to this location for a while until the alarm thing is fixed because that was NOT at all an enjoyable experience!"

It was placed in a cardboard box way to small, sides of it touching the box and icing peeling off the cake. I ask for them to fix it and put it in a larger box. Another person comes out and starts telling me that its cream cheese frosting and its a 'soupy' frosting that won't hold its shape proceeding to ask if I still wanted it redone since it will just keep happening...I have a background in cakes that is why we chose cream cheese buttercream frosting over chantilly for rosettes on the cake. They take it back to get it redone and place it in a larger box, like it should have been in the first place. Little did I know, instead of using ivory cream cheese frosting to fix the whole side of the cake, they use white. I didn't notice until we took it out at the baby shower. The white icing stuck out sorely. The actual cake tasted good, the service and experience that I received was not up to par. If you order a cake, make sure to check it first and if they mess up, don't expect it to be fixed properly.....sadly not my greatest experience and not sure if I would recommend it or come back."

When I went to the bakery counter to pick up some bread there were no bags to put you bread in, and you don't find anyone working at that counter so I was waiting, hoping someone would show up. After waiting for a few minutes which seemed like eternity and mentioned the lack of bags  to the lady who walked up from the back. She walks up to me and said (with here attitude) that there are no bags because it is not a help your self counter. I should ask her to give me the items. Which is not a problem but then there should be a sign put up and they should be at the counter not in the back room and lose the attitude. Also at the registers they should be trained as of how to pack the groceries. When I bought tomatoes and other heavier sturdier items they placed the tomatoes on the bottom of the bag... By the time I got home, I noticed that they were no longer tomatoes but juice."

The girl who worked in the cafe also stared at me as if I was from outer space and it made me so awkward I couldn't even speak. The women working in the hot bar were laughing at me and insulting me as I passed them. This was my FIRST time coming here and I never even knew what it was , so I had checked it out... These people are bullies. And to top this disgusting customer service off, it's really expensive. Spending $36+ just to be laughed at and mistreated ?  I'm surprised nobody else has that problem with the store. But I guess it's their neighborhood grocery store so it's normal. I'm just not saying it's the worst because after all, it did look pretty nice and had a lot to offer but the customer service from the entire staff was even uglier and the rudest I've experienced just like mostly anywhere."

I moved from Orlando and they have Specialty Stores everywhere but not here, so thought this would be great. Well, it was great for several years, bright intelligent Employees, Everything in stock, and a place you could just count on. Not now, something has changed in the last year. Four months ago I went in and the Escalator was broken, no biggie, I like to walk.  Then two weeks ago went in and wanted to buy a no Nitrate Ham, they usually have them out in the End Caps, nothing. Went Back today nothing, and it's 11 days until Easter. The guy was nice enough to go get me one from the Back, but I suspect that was the only one they had. Then when I came in the store, it was quite dead, I had a tiny cart with my stuff in it and my Purse it was out of the way. I was grabbing some lettuce. Some jerk Employee I have never seen before just shoved my cart out of the way, No need to do that just being an Ass. He kicked it 10 foot away. with my purse and everything in it. Again they were not crowded. He just wanted to be an Ass.  The Bright  Lovely employees were mostly gone and what I saw reminded me so much of Walmart. The Employees walking around had a thuggish  Look just like wallyworld. I saw a few of the regulars, but that was it. The produce was gross and the Nut grinders had one out of order.  This is the only store that carries Lactose free Yogurt in a 100 mile Radius and they only had 4 left I could go on and on, but won't. I'm sad, not sure what has happened in the last Year, or less than a year but it's certainly changed. I go into Whole Foods for Upper end foods, and quality people. I don't mind rude employees, but you just don't touch people's personal items and act like a Thug. I won't go back for a year, will try again in a year. In the meantime will look for something with a lot more Quality."

            "review_text": "Love this Whole Foods because of the Queen's Corner bar and tasting loft it has. You wouldn't think that a grocery store is a cool place to hangout, but this Whole Foods is a staple for many. The drinks are inexpensive as you can grab any bottle of wine or beer and open it up in store for no extra charge. Even better is that you can grab a cheese plate to go with your drinks or something from their hot bar. You can also get things made to order like a burger or sandwich. Besides the bar and tasting loft, there is also a nice outdoor patio on the second floor that offers a nice relaxed place to eat.  As a grocery store it is very clean, organized, and has high quality products. For daily shopping I find it to be too expensive and would really only shop there to get specialty items like vegan or vegetarian supplements. The wine and beer selection is decent, but other stores have a bigger selection. The staff has always been friendly and helpful which I appreciate. The bar keep is always on point too which helps."

We met in person initially, and I was able to taste test a few options. The staff there that day was such a pleasure to work with! I wish I had their names to give them kudos as well! But shortly after our initial meet and greet, all of my communication with Maddie was by email. She replied so quickly to every concern I had. She offered suggestions and made creating the perfect meal smooth and simple. I can't tell you how much a bride needs smooth and simple in preparing for her big day! So thank you to Whole Foods, the catering department, and Maddie. You made my \"Best Day Ever\" even better!!"

I ended up getting very few groceries because even on sale and with a coupon, prices are far too high. There is no need to spend double on organic, I can get the same quality elsewhere (or clean it). Even foods that are NOT organic are about 50% more. I must say that there are some things here you simply cannot get elsewhere that are perhaps worth the extra cost and time it would take to go to this store for those exclusive items. I also got some of their prepared food, which was really tasty and has great options. Overall, this store is overwhelming with options! Which I feel is good and bad. Usually, variety is a reason items at a store could cost more. But, of course variety makes things more interesting, they have just about everything you can imagine. Whole Foods has an ideal mission, a great atmosphere, and is obviously very popular."

Well it turns out selling other peoples products is not  good enough for companies like Wingman's or Whole Foods anymore. The temptation to make even more money by selling your own products (Whole Foods 365) seems to great to resist. Slowly all the products are being replaced by the Whole Foods 365 brand. No more choice, Whole Foods will decide what is the best for us and just stop carrying the things we like. I have already seen it happen with a few of the items that I would stop in there to purchase. I mentioned this to a girl at the check out and she told me that the 365 brand products are much less expensive. I don't shop at Whole Foods to save money. If I wanted to do that I could go to many other lower end grocery stores. I saw this same thing happen to Wingman's in the Northeast years ago and it too bad it happening to While Foods too."

You can think when you go in that it's too fancy and expensive based on looks but it's honestly cheaper than anywhere else you go and the produce actually lasts until you're finished eating it. Please keep in mind that this is a natual store so they do not sell over the counter medication. They have tons and tons of alternatives that are better for your body. This Whole Foods has honestly changed my quality of life. Their return policy is AMAZING! You can eat half of something, not like it, and they'll give you your full money back. If you want your family to be healthy come stop by, please don't let anyone's opinions turn you away."

Very environmentally friendly down to the carry out boxes/bags they use.  CONS: Parking.  Parking is very limited.  Being that the place is a combination of Starbucks, Trader Joe's and Sam's Club, people tend to stay a long time hence parking becomes scarce.  Prices are also a little steep."
