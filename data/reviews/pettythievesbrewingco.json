A massive positive about Petty Thieves is that their live music is of quality talent and never so loud that you can't converse with people at the same time."

The taproom has a speakeasy vibe and the beer is good but when told the brewery was \"closing soon\" my party and I promptly left the hidden room in the back and I put my 3/4 full beer on the bar counter while I went to the restroom. I came back 2 minutes later and my beer was gone. My brother then informed me that the bartender (short, bald guy with tattoos) came up to them and asked if I was going to finish the beer to which he replied \"yes, he's just in the bathroom and will be back in a moment.\" The bartender acknowledged this and went about his business but apparently came back and threw out my beer anyway. I was given no explanation for this or a replacement beer as this all happened over the course of a few minutes while in the bathroom and would have taken even less time to finish the beer after I got back, but the bartender apparently couldn't be bothered to wait another second to finish his duties for the night and instead chose to be quite petty and steal the beer I paid for. If nothing else, at least the name of this place fits the bill..."

It's in a bit of a weird location that's not visible from a main street, so I circled around the area for a bit before I could find it. The beer list is highly creative with a wide range of artistic, almost experimental beers along with some staples. I had an IPA and barrel aged stout and both were amazing. I also bought a to-go Oktoberfest that was also really good. To me, the venue may have been the best part. There are lots of options for seating from private booths to game tables, to couches and partitioned-off casual areas. This made for a perfect venue to work, hangout with a small group of friends, or have a big gathering. The outdoor seating has a great view of the city, and is set up well to be very welcoming. I didn't go into the \"secret room\" but I saw some folks going in and out. Very fun feature for sure. I'm not one to usually notice decorations, but I love the vibe in this place. Very creative but welcoming. I don't come to this part of town often, but if I did, I think this place would be a favorite for sure. Recommend highly."

I had one of their sour IPA's which was actually one of the best sour ipa's i've ever had. We we're completely blown away with their customer service, beer and hospitality. Also, a HUGE bonus, they have mimosas on Sunday's which is awesome considering my wife doesn't like beer but loves mimosas! Thanks Petty Thieves crew for making our day amazing!!!"
