We tried two items off of their seasonal menu and they are delicious. When sitting in, your iced items are served in thick glasses with seems like biodegradable straws. I had the iced “Tiramisù'” drink made with oat milk and my daughter had the “Tropic like it's hot” iced drink which includes matcha, mango syrup and some other things top with Tajin seasoning. These both have wonderful flavors so we ordered the same items this visit. The coffee shop is cute and pretty quiet. Service was a tad slow today but there were only 2 people working. I do wish they had an option of size choices but it is all one size.I like the taste of the coffee in my drink so definitely will be going back for a more simple coffee."

I am always in search of good decaf, but I have to get an Americano because no one really does drip decaf anymore and the Americano  can be hit or miss. This one was a hit-minus. So it had a good flavor, but not as bold as I've gotten at other shops. And it was a wee bitty 8oz cup for $3. Not what I was expecting. But maybe I could have gotten a 12oz it just wasn't advertised.  Glad I tried it."

Super cute atmosphere inside. The gentleman at the counter helped me decide what to order. I settled on their overnight oats. Hands down, the best oats I have ever eaten! I had an oat milk latte, hot. Simple, but delicious, a favorite of mine, so I would be particular. I saw in another review, a complaint about hot drinks in clear glasses? Stating that they won't stay hot? I am a habitually slow drinker. I take forever to sip on a hot drink. On this cold day today, my hot drink had no issues staying hot in the clear glass vessel. And, bonus points, it's super pretty!! As I explore my new neighborhood more, I definitely hope to return to Night Swim."

The coffee shop was very nice and clean. It has a very modern simplistic vibe and has a lot of seating to sit anywhere inside or outside. I would definitely come back here again."
