Every time I go in to order rarely is somebody behind the counter taking orders, wait around for a little to see someone stand up from a table to walk over minutes later just to say \"we don't have that sandwich anymore go check the menu\" oh sick I'll get out of line to walk across store to see the only visible menu. Just to see the exact same sandwich still on the menu to get back in a long line just to order. I placed an order to go over phone, said it would be ready in 15 minutes. Showed up in 10 expected to wait 5-15 more. Waited 35 minutes for one meatless wrap. 50 total minutes to make a wrap on a slow day. My final straw was when I went in to order, sat at the counter for a solid 5 minutes looking around for someone to take order but nobody was there, finally see a dude walk up to a lady sitting down to ask her something, she walks him over to the counter, literally told me to scoot over so she could take his order. Ridiculous. Stop hiring people because they look the part, your staff is useless"

I asked the guy behind the counter how long this late night menu was a thing and he said “over a year.” Which, is not true. I couldn't even order a usual sandwich. The guy behind the counter was rude and brought what I ordered out on a plate when I told him I wanted it to go. He then huffed and puffed, and wrapped it up to go. I've never had such awful service here. I'm a local to the neighborhood and I'll travel to other common markets around town to avoid the awful and rude service here. What a shame."

The bar side of things is a little too hip for me, but a lot of people lounge around with friends in the evenings.  The overall environment is cluttered, a bit messy, yet surprisingly warm and inviting, but that's a matter of preference. I find it very easy to relax here for reading/meeting with friends.  Downside: the food comes out super slow. I mean.. inordinately slow. But it's good when it arrives in the window so I deal with it!"

As of early May 2017 they are still working on stocking the store since they JUST opened and I look forward to their expanded offerings and prepared meals. Apparently they will have a fresh juice bar and will also have cold brew coffee soon so their offerings will be quite comprehensive. They have a great indoor/outdoor patio that is covered and should work as a four season dining area. Thankfully it is non-smoking and has a couple outdoor fans. The Common Market \"Oakwold\" is a cool spot for a quick bite or a hangout where you can order beer on tap or grab your favorite craft beer or wine from the shelves and pop the cap and serve yourself. Glad Common Market chose Oakhurst for their newest location!! We are already regulars and love having them as neighbors."
