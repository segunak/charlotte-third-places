            "review_text": "My delivery order from here was a disgrace and this review is based solely on the food quality and not a service or dine-in experience.  We ordered two breakfast sandwiches from here yesterday: the avocado toast with bacon and egg added and an egg, cheddar, and avocado sandwich with onions and pesto. Both sandwiches were missing avocado, which is an extra charge, including the AVOCADO TOAST. How does that happen? Not to mention that my $10.50 croissant sandwich was so pathetic and essentially an open face sandwich with one small piece of croissant and a sad portion of egg and cheese smooshed together that I mistook for the other side of the bread. It looks like I ordered an onion and pesto sandwich. The key lime pie was sizable and good.  Seems food quality and poor service are an issue at this location based on other reviews so we definitely will not be wasting money here again."

Staff is just friendly enough for such an early hour and polite. They seem to get along with each other and have fun, but they still prioritize the customer and greet you and smile when you walk in.  Pastries here are always good except SOMETIMES the classic croissant seems well-done for my taste. Vanilla sugar roll is delicious every time.  I like to order a soy latte, sometimes plain and sometimes with mocha or caramel added. Espresso flavor is always smooth and the milk and foam are always just right.  I'm usually in and out, and if it might take a while they warn me and apologize for the wait.  I wish i lived closer!"

Sunflour has quite possibly the best muffins in Charlotte, but that's all that would warrant a higher review.  The service leaves a lot to be desired with staff that never seems happy, and wait times that are hard to justify for coffee or baked goods.  The bread used on their sandwiches is always great, but the rest usually lacks flavor and any moisture.  To ensure it's not dry, it would need mustard (a 50 cents add on), or multiple condiments... otherwise, be sure you have water on hand.  I've tried this place for years and unfortunately it has lost its local bakery neighborhood feel as the goal seems to be expansion while compromising on service and taste."

I tired the Forager breakfast sandwich today and it was excellent. The truffle aioli really came through and paired well with the goat cheese and mushrooms.

We decided to try it again this past weekend and placed an online order for 4 sandwiches. After the order was confirmed, it said it would be ready at 10:15. We arrived a few minutes late at 10:20, expecting it to be ready but it was not. I stood by the prepaid order pick up without being acknowledged for over 5 minutes while workers were just pidding around. After finally getting the attention of someone, I was told our order was not ready and it would be up next. Fast forward 15 more minutes and it was still not ready. In total, our 10:15 order wasn't ready until 10:50 which is beyond acceptable. To make things worse we got home and they were prepared incorrectly. Sadly, we will likely not be visiting this location again due to the poor service."

I waited over 30 minutes for an iced mocha, people who had come in after me were getting their food before I even got my drink. My sister got her drink within 2 minutes of ordering but mine never came. When I attempted to explain this to her several times (at least 3) she kept cutting me off and asking me if I had gotten my “latte” which I had never ordered. But instead of waiting 5 second for me to finish my sentence she was brash, and cut me off several times like I didn't know what I was talking about. She also treated several other customers this way. Everyone else there was very kind and the girl working the drink station apologized profusely even though it wasn't her fault. But the managers attitude was very off putting and not representative of what I have come to know sunflour bakery to be. If I was rating just off her attitude it would be one star. I only added an additional one due to the kindness of the other staff members."

The order online and pick up process needs to be improved, I waited in line with no direction or update from who was working. Myself and others were very confused what we were supposed to be doing if we ordered online. I saw my food sitting on the back counter and had to get someone's attention and let them know I was there to pick up an online order."

Our only complaint: items are so popular (esp the GF items), they are frequently sold-out."

They usually sell out early so I would suggest going prior to 2pm to get one. I go just for the roll. If they are out of them, I leave. I gave 4 stars because the service here can be hit or miss. The staff for the most part is nice but I have gotten my cinnamon roll heated and they seem to have issues with something so simple. One time they burned it a  little and it was the last one. The young lady didn't say anything  when she served it to me and when I mentioned it she said “Oh yeah, I saw that. They left it in the oven too long.” She said she would replace it with something else if it was inedible however I guess it was the end of her shift because she left before I had a chance to talk to her again. Most recently, it wasn't warm enough but I didn't want to risk getting another burnt one so I just ate it anyway. More ttention to detail would garner a 5 star from me."

This place used to be my favorite but lately whenever I go there it is a 15-20 min wait for a latte when there are only 4 people in line and two employees at the counter. It should not take this long. Maybe they lack training which is something management should be taking care of.  For example today one employee took my order  then took the order of the girl behind me and made her iced coffee first before she started to make my latte even though I had been there first and ordered first, the other girl behind me received her items and left before I did. Then she started to make my latte but stopped in the middle to bag another customers muffins and later continue to make my latte. I believe three people came and left while I stood there waiting and then when I get to work it is not even made correctly."

However, if you are planning on bringing in your laptop to do some work like many do, be prepared to fire up a hotspot to connect to. The WiFi at Sunflour is atrocious and has been as long as I have been a customer (a year or so). I really like this place, but I expect any cafe these days to have a good WiFi connection. My rating would be 5 stars without considering the wifi troubles."

They also offer breakfast sandwiches, lunch sandwiches and soups, and coffee bar drinks. While every food item I have had here has been spectacular, the black coffee is the only thing I can approve of from the coffee bar. The lattes do not have enough flavor. There are much better places to go if you are looking for a latte. They have bar stools facing the window so you can look outside, and café tables throughout the interior. They also have an outdoor seating area, but it is very tiny, consisting of only three or four tables with two seats each. This establishment is friendly to those who would like to come and work on their laptops. Parking is difficult because there are multiple stores sharing a small parking lot. Many of the spaces are a tight fit if you have a mid to large-size car. Even with all of those factors in consideration, this is by far my favorite Bakery in Charlotte. Amelie's is absolutely overrated. If you like Amelie's, come here and try what pastries are supposed to taste like."

The sandwich as a whole could have been improved upon with more bacon and a little more cheese but I ate the whole thing anyway. The coffee is the kind that I seem to have a strange response to (gives me major brain fog) but it did have a good taste so if you don't have that problem, go for it. My friend bought me a snickerdoodle cookie which I ate later and it was delicious. I tend to prefer softer cookies but I'd definitely eat one again! Their scones looked amazing and I saw several people get them while I was there so that might be what I get next time. For a meeting place it was great and the wifi was spot on."

            "review_text": "I visited this establishment yesterday, and it ended up being the most expensive sandwich I have ever ordered. I went into the establishment and ordered a $9.00 sandwich and cookie Togo. The strip mall has a tow and booting service called Wheel Blockers patrolling the parking lot to ensure no one is leaving the center and visiting any neighboring shops. The problem is I was a victim of this predatory practice they call business. Sunflour Baking Company has a small sign on the door stating if you leave the property then you are subjected to be towed or booted. However, I was not under the impression if I left the parking lot to pick up a Togo order simultaneously at Showmars this was applicable, especially since the attendant saw me park my car and order my food in Sunflour Baking Company. I was gone no more than 3 minutes if that. As I walked to my car I noticed a boot on my car, and the attendant who was held up in his 96 white Toyota Camery jumped on of his car which was parked two spaces from me and instructed me I have a boot on my car, like the 7 years I spent in school I could not decipher it was a boot. Then I begin to explain to him I had two Togo orders in the same area and it did not make sense to get in my car to drive across 7th street just to pick up the other order and I could show him my receipt proving I was a paying customer in Sunflour bakery. He said it was against the rules and I would have to pay 75.00 to get the boot off. As I reach for my credit card he then begins to tell me the price is now 85.00 which infuriates me because I was not understanding why the price jumped 10.00 in less than 10 seconds. Hes says its because they have a 10.00 credit card service fee, which I believe is completely bogus because they are not legally allowed to not accept any form of US currency. Anyways, he points to the Friendly Mart across the street and says I can use their ATM. As I am trying to pay this man the 75.00 he is no where to be found because he is at HoHo Cherry House picking up his Togo food. I guess my questions is Sunflour and other business in the shop are paying Wheel Blockers to service their parking lot to ensure paying customers do not leave but he is taking breaks during his allotted work hours to purchase Chinese food. How do they know during his stretch in HoHo no one else walked across the street and abandon their cars for much longer than 3 minutes because their parking lot attendant was taking personal breaks during his work shift, questioning how often he is accountable for enforcing this rule? Also no where on any of these parking lot signs does it give pricing, enforcing a bigger issue of price gauging could be taking place as his pricing fluctuated. The attendant was unbelievably rude and I will never be purchasing anything again from this company again. I live less than .7 of a mile away and I would rather drive to Noda, Dillworth, South End, or Plaza where I am free to eat bonbons, croissants sub sandwiches, Jamaican, and burger without fear I am going to be towed. In total this trip to my local bakery costed me 90.00, wow for that price I could have bought a Steak from Del Frisco or Ruth Chris. No offense but shop local is always stressing shop local, but with your customer base being treated like this, haha I have to question what standards of loyalty one has."

The place is clean, comfortable, unpretentious, and there's plenty of parking. I only wish it were closer."

While the clean, spacious interior, and neat chalkboard menu looks appealing, the reality is far from it. On all three occasions, the place was nearly empty, and my order took over 15 minutes. Two of the three times my order was wrong, be it the type of bread or meat I chose. While I understand that \"all natural, organic\" ingredients cost more, over $6 for a meager breakfast sandwich is still not justified. There is a difference between paying more for quality and flat out overpriced. They have absolutely no condiments either for their rather bland food. I have also tried some of their \"gourmet\" baked goods, and was flat out unimpressed. I am not normally one to complain, but after multiple subpar experiences at this establishment, I feel the overwheming need to warn potential customers before they waste their time and money."
