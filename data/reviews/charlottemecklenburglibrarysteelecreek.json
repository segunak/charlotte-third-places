I don't have a printer and I don't ever plan to have a printer, so every once in a while when I need to print something, it's really convenient to be able to come here to do it.  They have an app you can use to upload your document and print it which is really convenient so you don't have to email it to yourself. They also used this during the pandemic when they weren't letting people inside.  If you're like me and don't want a printer, check out your local library!"

Kids area: Two touch screen kids computers Six regular computers Small DVD collection Large book selection Bean bags around for lounging Play area with a sectional type seating area with big cushions, a table with chairs and, puzzles. Rug with wooden play cube and small bins of toys. BEAUTIFUL  garden area with bin with outside toys. Staff was nice Story time (toddler) Stories are short (great for busy minds) Music is fun (lots of movement) Bubbles at end are nice  Negatives Story teller said \"if at any time someone is unhappy with the story, take them out and bring them back in when they're done\". I hate this because it usually embarrasses a parent. One person had to leave because of this. I don't think it's fair. Let the babies cry if they need to! Sign outside door telling others story time was full. We had plenty of room outside. There is no need to turn anyone away. Ever."

Mamas please note that if you are even 5 minutes late to attend one of their story time activities they will not let you in . Ms Joe ( runs this like the military) and  had no grace in allowing me to go in with my 7 mo old despite it being our 1 st time and driving 25 min to get there. Come on ya'll I was pretty bummed and disappointed being that this was my daughters first time ever attending story time . Ms Joe needs to be a bit more gracious and understanding . However I will try again next time and hopefully  the rest of the staff is more friendly and understanding."
