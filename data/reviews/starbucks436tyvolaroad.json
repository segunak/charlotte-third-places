After sitting in this specific Starbucks for over 1 hour…a Starbucks that I frequent nearly every day whether by drive thru or walk in…the person ringing me up had the audacity to ask me did I purchase coffee in the Starbucks that day…Jordyn Strickland the store manager  told me this is the policy to ask and I have been coming to Starbucks nearly everyday for at least 7 years and never have I ever been asked did I purchase a coffee in any Starbucks when getting a refill from any Starbucks team member from CT to FL especially when I was sitting in the store the entire time. Jordyn didn't even apologize for my experience! As a manager, she handled the situation very horribly especially because she knows I am always in here! I will not come back to this Starbucks and I am going to sell my Starbucks stock, prices have gone up, value and service have gone down, and consider taking my business elsewhere!"
