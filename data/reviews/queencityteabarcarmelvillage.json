There were students from the near by school all over the place with their bags all around each table. Even if they weren't using the table. Bags piled everywhere. We had no where to sit. I felt like I was in a high school cafeteria. The staff seemed a bit out of it and unhappy to be there. They were out of food and my order was wrong.  I got a ban mi that was dry and mediocre.  I did not get the spritzer I wanted with lemonade. They left out the lemonade. This is now nothing but a low quality high school hang out with no care for the rest of the public. I won't be back. I leave one star for the fries. They were good.  I just found my new favorite place. The Hokkaido milk tea was amazing. Korean BBQ was delicious. The lemonades are so refreshing. My favorite is the blueberry."

You can customize everything from flavor to ice to sweetness. This was the first place I ever tried Boba and while there are a lot of great places out there, QC has the freshest and best tasting drinks in my opinion. They also have a loyalty reward system too which is cool :) I haven't tried the food yet but it looks good. Everything including the drinks are made to order. There is a lounge area that is super cute and there are also tables inside and outside. Next to the fireplace there's an assortment of board games - I think that's really cool! I love how they have different independent vendors art and jewelry for purchase. I keep coming back because they are consistently great and the price is so good."

            "review_text": "I'm really, really hoping that my experience wasn't discriminatory in nature, but it certainly felt like it. The food was decent and I ordered a Vanilla Latte (super sweet) with the expectation of additional cost of course. I received my Latte and it wasn't as sweet as I'd like, so I looked to see if there was a sugar station. There isn't any sugar available to consumers (likely COVID-related), so I asked if they could squirt some additional flavor in it. I was then advised that once the drink was made it couldn't be altered, so at that time I was told that he could remake it, which I was ok with. He then took my cup and squirted additional flavoring in it (which I thought he couldn't do).  I went back up to order a Lemonade Spritzer and knew this time to speak more directly about to the sweetness and asked for no ice. The girl at the counter took my order and was sweet enough, he then came back and stated that I couldn't pay for extra sweetness on that drink because it would be too complicated and would alter the amount of seltzer. He then stated that I couldn't request that there be no ice or he would have to short my drink (like a bar tender does). I was so irritated at that point that I just asked for water. After this interaction I realized that there was a sign on the board that said ‚ÄúHow to Order.‚Äù This sign spoke to your ability to pay for both extra sweetness and no ice. I guess it was an opportunity provided to everyone but me...  Ultimately, I really like the vibe of this space, but was incredibly disappointed in my experience.  The staff member's name is Johnathan."

If the season crumbs fall off the fries, try dipping the rice onto it and enjoy! I got the pork patties banh mi sandwich, just right and unique in taste. The bread is soft and light crisp which is right for me, I don't like bread that's over done and crumbles all over the place. The unique note taste so fancy I thought the chef, from the korean tv series : chocolate, had made my sandwich. This doesn't have that bold original taste of headcheese but a rich and balance taste instead. She also got the mango slushie I got the taro slushie and let me tell ya, the ice is so soft like it's a crossbreed between Hawaiian ice and pelican's snow! When we're around pineville, we come here. It's also nice and quiet and peaceful, like a starbicks lounge but more calm and relaxing. Also restroom is clean and smells nice, I thought I was in a hotel. You gotta check it out!"
