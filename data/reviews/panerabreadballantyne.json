Receipt also printed as \"no eggwhite\". Picked up order and came home. Egg was in sandwich.  I have been to other Panera Bread in other states and places, and this is worst Panera Bread I have ever been  Worst service Worst Food Worst drink preparation- everything my husband has to tell them to remake when he doesn't have to substitute anything except no whip cream.

I have had problems with this location in the past, with some rude managers or people not taking precautions seriously. Errors on my order, such as not changing gloves or putting the wrong condiments on my sandwich, could cost my life. However, on Monday, October 24th, 2022, I had the best experience with this location. Cynthia was working in the kitchen at the time when I placed my order and I went to the take-out window to tell her my accommodations for my allergies: please change gloves, new knife as I am allergic to some breads, new cutting board, etc. She took my allergies very seriously, even telling another associate not to touch my order because of how severe my allergies are. She was very cautious and alert with my order and she made me feel completely safe. I will definitely be coming back to this location because of Cynthia and her extreme precautions with my life-threatening allergies. The only reason I am giving this location a 4-star review instead of a 5-star review is because I have had recent complications with my orders, as I am a regular customer, to which one of them I did not even eat the food due to the employees not accommodating my allergies. At that time (it has been within the past month), the manager who made my sandwich did not use a new knife while cutting my bread and did not use a new cutting board, so there was potential cross-contamination with allergens. Also, when ordering a smoothie, there was chocolate sauce on the lid (I ordered a Strawberry smoothie, so idk how chocolate sauce got on the lid) which I am not sure if I am allergic to or not. I stress my allergies every time I dine at this location, asking the employees to change their gloves, use a clean knife, a clean cutting board, and be extra cautious, but yet some employees and managers do not understand the severity of my allergies. Cythia did VERY well handling my allergies and I will definitely be requesting her assistance next time I dine in."

Found my order and immediately offered to send another driver out to correct the issue instead of just a refund. In addition, she and her team included some cookies for the inconvenience.

Unfortunately, this morning I ordered breakfast incorrectly at the Panera near my house vs my work. I was disappointed to learn that management was not able to make the souffles despite the hundreds of dollars a month I spend at Panera. I didn't complain when I had to wait for a different order because they were out of inventory in the morning or their being late on the order and that causing me to be late to work multiple times. But to not appreciate your customers patronage by helping with a human error. It ok I'll go to Chick Fil A where I'm greeted with a smile, known by name, and they memorize my order each morning. Food prices are getting too high for customers to deal with this."

The brick pavers had old food and dried up spilled drinks, various trash items, bird droppings, and everything else imaginable. I told the cashier when I ordered, and she thanked me and said “sorry”. I cleaned a table off, myself,  (the one with the least yucky food or trash stuck on the ground) and was there for over two hours.  At NO point did anyone come to clean or check the outdoor area. And the inside was not much better. This was at a “slow” time. The restaurant was not at all busy and appeared to have plenty of staff. I Will NEVER eat at this location again. If the visible areas are that horrible, I can only imagine the kitchen or other places that public can't see. Disgusting. 0 stars."

They got a makeover inside but still fall short on items they advertise, the last few times I've visited they didn't have avocados and the orders I get usually have it, I'm glad they tell you before you pay but its a bit annoying how many times I've walked out because of this. There was one time I really wanted one of the hibiscus drinks and they didn't have it or my alternative. My order gets messed up half the time I order so I've made it a habit to check before I leave. I dont know if I would recommend this Panera bread but if you do go, make sure you check your order before leaving and make sure you get your receipt, cause that has saved me a lot of arguing."

We placed a small order for breakfast and we accidentally placed here since its WHERE WE ALWAYS ORDER FROM and we really needed it at another location bc we were out of town. Manager wouldnt give us the 16 dollars back and cancel the order no matter how much we pleaded. This is the same Panera who never had soap in the bathroom. How clean can it be anyway? We wont be back and we will make sure no one from ballantyne Corp is either."

Then the kitchen staff and the person standing by the food checkout always have a nasty attitude like we are a inconvenience to them. like hello if you didnt have the god damn item say no and i would have more then gladly went else where to eat. the only reason i stayed was because i was told you had what i wanted. obviously team has no training. no communication and horrible customer service. oh and BTW i use to work for panera back in 2010. so do better because we knew how to treat our customers."

We had been eating there at least twice a week when we noticed the quality decreasing with each visit until my wife experienced a pretty serious bout of food poisoning. About the only thing she'd eaten in the past 2 days was Panera.  A few weeks later, I convinced her to try it again. We ordered rapid pickup and got a couple of Seasonal Greens salads and a turkey sandwich. The salads looked as though they'd been made the day before. They were disgusting. The tomatoes literally looked spoiled. I can't imagine being the person that made these salads and thinking they were ok to serve.  To top all of this off, I have a relative who began working at Panera a few months ago. This relative, who has also worked at Chipotle, says they would never eat Panera unless they witnessed the food being made. Panera has very little sanitary guidelines for their employees and our relative says that cooks regularly bus tables or take out the trash and come back to handle food without washing their hands or changing their gloves. There is also no glove changing policy so you can be sure that the people handling your food are not sanitary. Its no wonder my wife dealt with food poisoning  after eating there.  I highly recommend avoiding the Panera Bread in Ballantyne."
