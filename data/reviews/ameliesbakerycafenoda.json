The cashier volunteered that Amelie's celebrate birthdays by giving free eclairs(FYI 'all' customers). So I told the cashier I just had a birthday last week - she scrunched up her face and went to clear it with a manager before giving me the free eclair(which was confusing to me).I was not sure if it was the date or the offer was for only 'certain' customers. Starbucks and a lot of of similar businesses have the same offer for their customers. I really enjoy Amelie's food and drinks."

            "review_text": "Great bakery. We've been to the three locations many times. Fresh pastries and friendly personnel. Sadly not a place where kids and families are very welcome by some of the staff.  ::::::::Some staff need to be trained in customer service to treat customers fairly and be inclusive to families with kids::::::::  This review goes for a very uncomfortable experience we had on this location. There were a few kids plying in the patio for a while. Their family left and when my son came inside, a customer sitting nearby came to us to complain that we were opening the door too much and the cold was coming in. My son had only opened the door that one time. I told her that he had just come in that time. The lady was on her laptop, on a meeting and clearly too busy to pay attention to what really happened. She had just also told another customer that he couldn't sit on the table next to her because she was on her meeting. (The guy said, but it's only me, I'm alone) The lady got upset, and went to get the manager. I was ok with that, as I expected the manager to ask first to know what had happened before making decisions. To my surprise, the person who came (girl with black hair dyed white and blue in the front) came over assuming that the lady complaining was totally right. She didn't ask even once about what happened before she went ahead calling our son to come back inside because she was going to lock that door. I went there and asked her why, I was trying to explain what happened. She wasn't interested in knowing our side of the story. She misunderstood me, and somehow heard I was calling her stupid, which I swear I wouldn't do. She was just really not in a good emotional place to be objective and/or calm. I can tell she was young, so I attribute this to her inexperience. However, it is not justified. I told her, hey, I don't want to fight with you, but you should give me a chance to speak too. Obviously, I felt offended as she said she had to ask me to leave just because I was trying to explain to her that we were not the ones opening the door. Honestly, I don't even know how you get to this point just because of a door and a misunderstanding. If you are representing a business which market is clearly a lot of families, you must know how to talk through these situations. I'm a mother and, of course I'm not the only customer that matters, but it DOES MATTER how you communicate things to customers. It DOES MATTER your willingness to be fair, to be respectful, to be kind, to listen, to be INCLUSIVE with your customers. Don't take sides, first LISTEN and then find a middle ground. And above it all NEVER talk like that to your customers. Let them also explain themselves. You can do better than this."

In addition to wanting dessert, my husband wanted something to eat. There was a sizable line when we arrived. But we knew the food would be well worth the wait!  I was disappointed because they were out of the salted caramel apple cider that I really had my sight set on. So I opted for a chai latte with oat milk. I had a cookie dough macaron and chai latte macaron as well.  My husband had the chicken + pesto + goat cheese sandwich along with the salted caramel brownie layer torte.  I can always count on Amelie's for a consistently great experience!"

It is SUPER slow and there is a difference in quality in the pastries and the way they are presented. The croissants sit out on the counter instead of in the pastry case so when you are waiting in line for 40 minutes and looking at them, it really makes your appetite go away knowing they've been sitting out there since 8am (I'll add a picture for fun). I also don't like that you have to wait in the long line even if you just want a coffee, however I didn't mind at park road Amelie's since it was much quicker and the staff actually knew what they were doing. I am currently writing this as I sit in line (going on 40 min) looking at the gross pastries when all I want is a coffee. I will never stop going to Amelie's but I hope they can improve the NoDa one‚Ä¶"

We had the raspberry and caramel ones and they were both delicious. We shared a tartine with bacon and fig jam and it was so good. We got the 1/2 tartine, which was a very good size. I got a blueberry cheesecake macron for the heck of it and it was a delicious little treat. The decor is really great and super inviting.  Why they didn't get 5-stars: The asparagus soup could use a little more \"umph\", there was some flavor missing. The pain au chocolate had good chocolate flavor, but should be a bit more flaky (it was a little dense)."

The store is well decorated, well lit and there is a lot to see. They have a huge Eiffel Tower in the corner of the store, super nice. We tried the sweets and the baguette. Go for the baguette with butter. The sweets and sugary, cold and dry. The baguette is perfect, fresh and delicious. 3 ladies gave me a hard time to warm up my sweets but a 4th one gave me new sweets, told me she would warm them but when I got to taste them they were cold. Don't know if will come back again. Definitely a experience"

I asked them what kind of sweeteners they have and he was talking so fast it was hard to keep up. his name was Anthony. but other than my bad experience with the coffee for my first time there, the macarons were really good! i tried the cotton candy (10/10), the peaches and cream (10/10), the watermelon (8.5/10) and orange (2/10). Cotton candy has always been my favorite ice cream flavor from cold stone. the shop was adorable, i absolutely loved every decoration they had. i would definitely come back, even though i had 1 bad experience, but a good one as well.

A worker came up to me and asked if my dog was a service dog and I told him he's an ESA and we're just grabbing to go and he said it's fine. He was friendly. We ordered everything and while we were waiting for our last item this other worker from behind the counter basically kicked me out because of my dog, even after I told him that I a spoke to someone else and they said it was ok he still said ‚ÄúI need the dog to be outside‚Äù So basically go wait outside in 100 degree weather because I'm carrying a tiny dog that's not bothering anyone or touching anything.  Now let's talk food. We ordered a sandwich and 2 pastries. Everything is way over priced for what you get. The baguette sandwich was so tiny and not worth the 8.50. I've lived in Paris for 4 years and have had plenty of bigger baguette sandwiches for 5$! The lemon tart or tarte au citron tasted horrible! It did not taste like a lemon tart at all! Other pastries were named wrong as well like the chocolate croissant which is actually called pain au chocolat. If you want to have a fake/knock off Paris experience than go check it out. If you want the real deal than this is not the place."

Approaching the ordering area one may be overwhelmed by the variety of what one might at first glance believe to be a casual and small cafe experience but this bakery/cafe is here to impress. The service of their upbeat and cheerful employees will make quick work of helping you make a delicious decision. For my meal I enjoyed a delectable marriage of chicken, goat cheese spread, spinach, and sun dried tomato aioli on a beautiful baguette style bread. The flavors practically danced on my tongue to a symphony played out by whatever gorgeous blend of spices they marinaded their chicken in. This is not to sell short the delicious stew of chicken, sausage, beans, corn, and onion with an almost Greek tasting blend of spices mixed in that I ordered with my sandwich. Their macarons were masterfully crafted in the traditional manner and their chocolate creme brulee did not disappoint. All in all, there is undoubtedly no reason to skip visiting Am√©lie's so long as you're in Charlotte within their operating hours."

Granted, they needed more space, but they managed to complete clear out the uniqueness and coziness that made my friends and I recommend \"Amelie's - the real one on NoDa, not the uptown location\" to newcomers to Charlotte. If I wanted to eat macaroons in a grocery store ambience, I'd simply go to Publix down the street (and frankly, Publix' macaroons are better). And now I see that this location closes at 10:00pm every night (which is even earlier than weekends at the Rock Hill location) so going there to sober up after a night on the town is out of the question now. I don't know how the owners of a business could be so clueless as to why their place of establishment was popular in the first place"

It's almost like a Disneyland version of the original. But what else can you expect in Charlotte?

The second iced coffee was completely different with some \"oat milk\" that was clumpy and settled on the bottom of my cup like sludge. It wouldn't mix into the drink which tasted really bad. If that was all then I wouldn't be writing this review, but the pastries were also sub grocery store quality.  Again, I wouldn't have let that lead to a one star review. Just because the mirror tart was a very thick crust with essentially stale buttercream frosting on top and my second iced coffee was thrown out because of it's consistency and taste doesn't equal a one star review. We all have off days.  It was the chicken salad sandwich. Raising it to my mouth I had a momentary thought of \"wait why does this look and smell like a tuna sandwich?\" But I was very hungry so I went with choosing trust in the Restaurant over my senses. Immediately I felt a slight gag reflex, like my body didn't want to swallow what I was chewing. It tasted off, is the best way to put it, and definitely not like chicken salad.  Well I ate most of the sandwich before choking a bit on a large chicken bone and that was just my limit. Well plus the building sense of nausea, so I left to finish errands.  About ten to fifteen minutes later I'd made it to grocery shopping and ended up vomiting in the urinal after almost throwing up into a plugged nasty toilet but catching myself last second. While vomiting into that urinal and then feeling really unwell for the next day I did regret eating at this \"French\" bakery.  I wouldn't recommend eating or drinking here."

The coffee was weak, the quiche tasted ok but was also a bit overcooked and dry, the tartine was under the broiler too long (hard toasted bread and bacon that had that overdone taste from being reheated too long), but the chocolate croissant was acceptable.  It is clearly also a very unsafe and overbearing environment operated by members of the Religion of Masks that dictates you wear their expression of faith and participate in their rituals of wearing a face covering while standing in lines, and then not wearing them while sitting. It's an odd practice and a strange culture to someone from a place where there are no establishments of the Religion of Masks.  I even had one of their young converts approach me and inquire if I had a mask in order to participate in their ritual. I did not intend on joining their controlling cult, since I was unaware the bakery was run by the Church of the Mask and I don't like others impose their faiths on me, I did however oblige the request to participate in their mask ritual since I was in their temple or whatever they call the places for worshipping the masks.  It gives you the creeps though as you look around at the cult of the muzzled people. Reminds me of Orwell's Animal Farm, they even boiled all the past complex and contradictory rules and rituals down for the simple minded, with a request to ‚Äúplease wear a mask‚Äù, with a small little passive-aggressive subscript of ‚Äúit is required in the building‚Äù ‚Ä¶ it may as well have read ‚ÄúMask people good, no mask people bad‚Äù."

French pastry is a specialty, it's not going to be the same price as your local grocery store bakery. The sandwiches are actually better priced than many other delis I've tried in Charlotte. The drinks are about the same as other independent coffee shops.  I also don't understand the reviews mentioning lack of options. The case is always well stocked no matter when I go. Maybe I'm just easy to please after experiencing the French bakery in Memphis that had maybe a 3 baguettes and 2 eclairs if you went after 2pm.  The decor is unique and fits the theme well.

I waited months to post this as I know the pandemic has hit everyone hard, but we are two years in now - it's adapt or die time.  The selection of pastry is usually abysmal these days, and even worse the quality of the food continues to decline. This was an issue even before Covid but it has gotten much worse. Service, never exactly a strong suit, is now completely in the gutter. Staff are not only slow, but surly and snarky, and seem to have no knowledge of the menu. Today I waited nearly twenty minutes for a single slice of quiche, which arrived almost cold and undercooked, during which time my coffee had also gone cold.  I can no longer recommend Amelie's to friends, and would instead suggest Villani's or Suarez bakeries."

Our drinks were forgotten about (our order must have been checked off the screen because they had to re-add them) and we had to finally ask where they were after everyone who ordered after us got theirs, luckily the guy stopped what he was doing and started making them but didn't apologize or offer us anything to make up for it. On top of that my drink was extremely bitter when I know I ordered something sweet and my chocolate croissant was really disappointing with barely any chocolate inside. Sad that this place didn't live up to our memories and made a disappointing end to our anniversary trip. Will definitely be encouraging family and friends to not ever go back."

Also, you just have to wait at the counter for your name to be called for your order. This is quite ineffective when the food takes so long to come out. I wasn't asked if my order was take out or not and it was packaged to go....and it STILL took 45 minutes.  Still, I've heard such good things about this place and it had a good vibe.

I was standing there for at least 10 minutes looking at them chatting and then one of them called me saying that my order is ready but it wasn't even my order, it was somebody's else. He looked up my name to see what I had and said it's gonna be quick. Then he forgot my croissant and I had to go back and ask for it. And my latte was just terrible.

I asked if there was any coffee left and she said no so we checked out. My husband had asked the barista if he had any left and he said he did. So I went back to the counter to tell Riley I wanted to buy a coffee and again she rolled her eyes and huffed and puffed acting mad that she had to ring me up a coffee. My friends behind me in line had asked if there was any left or if they could make some and she very rudely just said ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù. As she said this, my friends watched the barista behind the counter POUR OUT THE REST OF THE COFFEE and they refused to serve them. We were treated very rudely from the moment we got in line by this Riley person and will not return."

I only took away one star because the macrons, they look amazing but they never taste amazing. I've tried so many flavors and I can never differentiate which one I'm eating, and the tops are always so hard and not shiny. Plenty of other options that are really good like the croissants!"
