It was not clean at all .. wet table and dirty seat.. I had all my positive vibes turned into depressed feelings .. I gave 2 only because the paradise latte was very nice I took with me and I sat out side the resturant neer to Dessellrs.

It was a very gorgeous and elaborate space with terrific drinks and cutting edge equipment and methods. I heard the brand started here in Charlotte and the owner was Vietnamese (which made sense), so while visiting the city I was excited to try the original. I haven't had a good Vietnamese iced coffee since living in VN, so I was very hopeful. It was strange that I had to pay extra for the sweetened condensed milk because that is literally the other essential ingredient besides coffee in a ca phe sua da (VN iced coffee). Unfortunately, the drink was horrible, and much more like a thin, tart latte than a rich and robust VN iced coffee. The atmosphere and seating were very pleasant and the barista was terrific, but the overpriced drink was disappointing for sure."

Apparently after 2 week (May 8), the barista(dark hair) recognized us and intentionally made 4 out of 6 drinks wrong from size, to hot or cold and the milk alterative. When a staff member intentionally makes a drink incorrectly, management should reassess who they hire. Someone can come in with health issues and cause health risk for that person.

She warmed up my blueberry muffin - it's a little thing, but also means a lot. How many times have you been in a coffee shop and wondered how good your treat would be if it was warmed up? (It was delicious, by the way.)  I never felt pressured to give up my table. It's a COVID-compliant establishment and I felt comfortable and safe there. I'll definitely come by again and maybe try the snickerdoodle coffee, which sounds amazing. Greta, thank you for your hospitality!

My husband is obsessed with the macadamia milk offered as an option. I personally love the iced chai tea latte. The shop is always nice and clean, and the employees are super kind. Parking is large and very easily accessible to be in uptown, with no fee to park which impresses me for the location. I also love that someone handicap can easily access and navigate the shop from outside. We come back again and again, highly recommend!"

After another 5 minutes - this is a pic of the beer we're waiting for- she says something is wrong with the tap. She did at least offer a refund- but we waited another 5 minutes for management to come out and give us the refund. Not the girls fault honestly."

The environment is lovely and warm, the service was terrible this morning. I stood at the counter for a good 5 to 6 minutes with no barista or employee in sight. When she showed up, no apology or explanation, no thank you when I payed (she actually said 'you're welcome' instead), just no personable attributes going on- just another customer, who cares kinda vibe. I ordered the Guatemala, which was ok. Their coffee has a very 'beany', earthy flavor, not much personality. I prefer Starbucks or Not Just Coffee for taste. I'd probably come back for other beverages, wifi and convenience ONLY."
