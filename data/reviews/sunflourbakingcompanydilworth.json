I was not asked what type of bread I wanted - but whatever. Then waited 15 min which was odd because there was no one else waiting. There was only 3 other customers sitting in the bakery having coffee. Now I will say I did not tip (it was togo and an overpriced sandwich plus it was drip coffee and she handed me a bag of chips). The 1 star is for the sandwich. I ordered the turkey, brie, and cranberry \"spread\" sandwich. It came out with a glob of spread in the center of sandwich, 1 slice of turkey and the brie only in the center of the sandwich. It was just awful! I can only assume it was because I did not tip. I need to remind myself to never order sandwiches and stick to coffee and bakery items."

When I arrived, one of the associates was having trouble finding my order because it had been taken/given to someone else….after the associate realized it was missing, instead of offering a refund or some kind of reparation, she asked if I wanted to take someone else's order…which was crazy to me. Of course I said no and asked for my food to be remade. I waited 15 minutes, hoping that when my order finally came out it would be accompanied with a remedy. No such balm came so I had to ask for a refund. The manager kindly issued a refund without hesitation, thankfully. This is my second time eating sunflower and the magic of the first experience was lost this time around. The food just isn't as good as I remember, but it's still one of the best biscuits I've had in the city. I would order again…ps: the menu says roasted tomatoes but my biscuit came with one lone tomato slice and I'm pretty sure I'm missing my pesto sauce…lol I just wish things went smoother."

After being reassured multiple times by the cashier that our sandwiches were being made, we left with a refund because he had never given the slip to the back and they ran out of bread!! Not sure how they expected to remian open for 4 more hours with absolutely no product. Staff was flippant, unapologetic and annoyed when we were upset we never got our food.

I ordered both this morning at 9 am and when the food got here they were both replaced with regular croissants. No one notified me that they would be switched.

Me as a European it's annoying to have sour espressos in every coffee shop, that is the result if the water goes through the beans too soon. I asked the lady, she said they serve \"sweet\" espresso... it was sour. If you want a great chocolate croissant, go to optimist hall, this won't be the place for that either. The sandwich (#5) was really dry that, personally I would get in contact with a local sauce maker and on side add/promote sweet/mild/hot sauces with my food. That's a win-win. Why 3 stars? -even if the products are not excelent, the place is okay. I like the style and the feeling when you step in."

Customer Service: I've worked in the coffee service industry for 3.5 years and I've never seen such a poor way to handle Customer connection and retention. no eye contact, no friendly tones, and barely any acknowledgment. An example of this is not asking to warm up pastries.  Expediting: There was one staff member literally standing around waiting for someone to just make an order while others stood in line. You could minimize waiting times by expediting orders and shifting priorities based on who needs support. This is common sense folks...  Overall experience: The outside seating is a nice touch. But the flimsy wood chairs and tables take away from the experience."

Service at the Dilworth location is consistently slow and the young staff they have in the front of house give off an apathetic vibe. This has clearly been reflected in the quality and timeliness of every experience I've had there. On one a occasion, we placed a pickup order which took an additional 40 minutes to receive past the initial 25 minute wait time we were given on the website. Over an hour for 2 breakfast sandwiches?! Every time we'd go to the counter to check on the status of the order we were told just a couple more minutes - meanwhile our coffees were ready but NOT given to us, only to get cold while they sat on the counter for nearly an hour. Another time I came shortly after opening when there was no wait but it still took nearly 30 minutes for a single breakfast sandwich to come out correctly (an incorrect order was given to me after about 12-15 minutes) and when I got home with it the bread seemed stale and inedible. I don't mind waiting for a quality, made-to-order product, but all of our orders here have left something to be desired and certainly have not been worth the painful wait times and meh service."

What doesn't make sense is that they constantly lied about my order being made, and after an hour admitted that they lost my ticket. I asked for a refund, which they said would be done at the end of the day, and would contact me saying so. That never happened, so I emailed the restaurant the next day asking for my refund. That was 2 weeks ago with no response by anyone at Sunflower. Now I'm going through my credit card company to dispute the charge since Sunflower haven't taken up the responsibility in getting me my refund. This is absolutely horrible management if this is the response one gets for reasonably asking for a refund for not getting their order!"

They also give me the wrong size half the time. If you order any modifications on your food, it's doubtful they will accommodate those modifications.

I ordered the zucchini brownie and a sweet potato/peanut butter cookie that was not described well after asking twice what it was but I love sweet potato and peanut butter so figured it couldn't be bad. My daughter had the croissant and a hot chocolate. The brownie had potential but my scratch made flourless brownies taste better from home. The cookie had things in it that made me not finish (again it was not described well from the beginning), the taste was okay but I do not have to have either again. My daughter is a hot chocolate connoisseur and she disclosed it was not great. BUT the croissant was good...but you can get a good croissant most anywhere.  The service was even less thrilling than what we ordered. The two girls working weren't rude per se but sometimes great service makes you overlook the places where there is lack. The bites and the hot chocolate were better than the service. Maybe they were having a bad day but I did not feel any hospitality or level of friendliness that I expect from a neighborhood bakery...maybe it's because we don't live in that neighborhood ...I don't know but I don't have to ever return. Glad so many folks love it. I guess it's a matter of taste and \"taste\".  I would like to give them a try for a sandwich and perhaps they can redeem themselves with the flavor part...I will order online to keep my interaction with staff to a minimum to avoid another underwhelming customer service experience.  I have traveled the world and love local spots with good food and good service. Didn't get that here."

            "review_text": "The Bad: We'll cut to the chase here. The East Blvd location is NOT practicing social distancing. I went yesterday (Sunday) morning as a treat for my boyfriend's birthday. It was around 9 AM. Objectively and most likely the busiest time for the bakery, I'll give them that, but when we drove into the parking lot we saw a line almost out of the door and people waiting around inside. I told my boyfriend we could order online instead and just go in briefly to pick up the order, to avoid as much contact as we could. We made the order at 9:28, and the online service said it would be ready at 9:48, so we sat in the car for a while. At 9:50, I headed inside by myself to pick everything up. First, the online order pickup table is to the right of the main counter, which is also the direction that the line snakes around, meaning I would have had to be within 6 feet of at least 5 people just to get my order. I asked the cashier if she could snag it for me, and she went over to grab it. (The front of house staff were great throughout this experience, and this review is not a reflection on them.) I had ordered two breakfast sandwiches, two iced drinks and a croissant. Everything was ready but the breakfast sandwiches; there seemed to be some confusion between two front of house staff members about where the sandwiches were. It took an extra 30 minutes for the sandwiches to be ready.  Look, I get it. It's a busy Sunday morning, and you're wide open. Normally I'm a patient person. But my whole point of ordering online was to avoid standing in your store, where there are no markings on the floor to keep people spaced or a capacity sign on the front door. The line looked like any normal slammed pre-COVID bakery on a Sunday morning. People were not spaced out. And there I was stuck waiting for 30 extra minutes in that environment, constantly trying to move position to have the most amount of people away from me and HIGHLY uncomfortable the whole time. By the time I got the sandwiches my iced drinks were watered down and I was ready to write this review, but I did want to hold off as I hadn't tried the food yet. We got home (5 minute drive) and realized the sandwiches themselves were lukewarm as well. This only further added to irritation-- if the sandwiches had been done for a while, why did I sit in there for 30 minutes? Between the in-the-car waiting period and in the bakery itself, it took almost an hour for my online order to be done. If it was going to take that long, I would have rather waited at home and quickly picked up instead of putting myself in a potentially dangerous exposure situation.  In short-- guys, this virus is scary. Regardless of your views, it is real and terrifying to some people. It was an abstract concept at the beginning and is becoming more real as people I know post about contracting the virus themselves, and as the Carolinas reach insane peaks. We try to be careful while still supporting local, because we know it's tough and we want you to make it through this, but at least hold up to the option of staying safe if you're going to provide online ordering. I won't be coming back until the worst of COVID-19 is over, and I'm really sad to say that.  The Good: That being said, the food was delicious. Again, I'm a big Amelie's fan, but Sunflour just does it....better. You won't find as many options as far as actual sweets go, because Sunflour is a bakery first and foremost, but they've got it figured out. The breakfast sandwiches were HUGE. I had a bacon, egg, and cheese on a croissant and my boyfriend had the mozz tomato and spinach on a cheese biscuit. I was so jealous of that cheese biscuit, but the croissant was crazy buttery and flakey. The drinks didn't necessarily thrill us, but I suspect it was because they were pretty watery by the time we got to enjoy them. I got a chocolate croissant to go for the next morning's breakfast, and I can't say enough good things about it as well.  I'm sorry, Sunflour. But do better, for the people who love to support you and for Charlotte as a whole."

The almond croissant was pretty good but lacked on filling - it was sparse and all on one side of the croissant. The cupcakes were great - even the a couple days later they were very moist.  Edit: was surprised with some pastries from here again in April 2020. Disappointment. The almond and chocolate croissants had a teeny bit of filling. It felt like a quarter sized dollop of filling. The croissant itself was pretty good and flaky, but if I'd wanted a plain croissant, that's what I would've gotten. The blueberry cream cheese danish was good though!"

If you login through facebook, it wants your email, name, sex, location, birthday and wants to be able to post on your behalf. You can not connect unless you agree to either one of these. I probably will not be coming back unless its just for a quick coffee - which again, is great, along with the service and creative sandwiches.  Funny story, there was a little boy in front of me was admiring the variety of deserts and said I just want one chocolate cupcake......well.... maybe 2.  So deserts are good too. Just their wifi policy is terrible."
