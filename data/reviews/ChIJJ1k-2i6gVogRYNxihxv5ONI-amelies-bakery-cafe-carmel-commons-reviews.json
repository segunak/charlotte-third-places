(I came 7/25/24 at 9:15am, if you want to tell the young guy with dark hair that took my order to get his ears checked). I absolutely hate vanilla. I tried it, and it tasted very fake, barely masking the hydrogenated soy bean oil in it. I tried a bit on the top, and it was so gross that I just threw it away. We ordered in, and my drink came in a to go cup, and my friend's came in an actual glass. There goes getting any actual cute photos. Make up your mind. My friend ordered a hot chocolate, which wasn't bad, albeit plain all things considered. My chai latte was gross. It had almost no spices in it, which is why I suspect they put a ton of cinnamon on top, to try and mask this. It basically just tasted of steamed milk, which is freaking gross. I live in a pretty small city, and there is WAY better chai lattes there than this place. Waste of money.\n\nAlso, do something about the ants on your patio that are eating your customers when they sit outside."

I truly enjoyed the overall atmosphere and vibe. The employees were very nice, and overall I loved it.\nDesserts;\nI had a few different ones and so did a business partner of mine who I was meeting up with and we enjoyed all of it.\nWe had\nChocolate Silk Tart 8/10 (no soggy bottom. Perfect. The chocolate custard reminded me of my mothers)\n*Tiramisu 8/10 (not dry at all. Perfectly soaked in coffee)\n*Creme Brulee 9/10 (they torched it fresh)\n*Salted caramel brownie 7/10 (you can tell caramel was cooked properly with how well it held up)\n*Banana Cream Tart 7/10 (no soggy bottom. Perfect)\n*Cheese Danish 7/10 ( could use more cream cheese but overall very flaky and good taste)\n\nOverall everything wasn't nastily sweet like you get with some american bakeries. Everything you could actually taste what they were made with and not just sugar.\n\nI really enjoyed it. She really enjoyed it. She went to the bathroom and stated they even had a secret code word for woman in case they are in trouble to discreetly tell employees. Very happy with that. Not a lot of places do that. Bathrooms were very clean and nice on the mens side."

Not smooth at all. Therefore, I gave it back and although they admitted it shouldn't be that way they didn't have any fresh ones to swap with because that whole entire batch came from the main store.

A \"large (diameter=3 inches)\" pecan tart is now 6.50 before tax. I would (maybe) agree to pay this price if the coffee section/baristas would be making it right and consistent. Still it became very, very expensive.\n\nI did not want to hate it. I just don't understand why should I pay so much for this kind of service (most of my complaints are regarding coffee quality). I know I can find another place but the location of this one is good for me. And it used to be better.\nPlease take some effort to educate baristas and improve the quality of coffee."

Today we got their lunch sandwiches and fruit tart. Lunch sandwiches are way over priced for what they have. They did not offer refill for my iced tea and fruit tart was average. On top of that their ambiance is not very \"calm, relax or charming\" it is more like chaos. They have some many pieces that does not match. Not my favorite.

They did refund our mo ey for the food but it was frustrating nonetheless. We never did try the food and probably never will. The staff we talked to about it were rude and blamed the backup on the kitchen staff. My girlfriend ordered a small tea and the tea was large but very weak. She asked for another tea bag and an employee took her over to the area where the tea bags were at the end of the bar and told her to pick out the tea she wanted, she even told her to try a couple different ones which was kind but then the guy making the coffee and drinks who said he was a manager told her \"Hey, what are you doing, you cant just take those.\" She explained to him that his employee told her to select a few and he said \"So.your just going to take them and walk out of here with them?\" and her reply was \"Yep!\"."

(She speaks fluent French) So I whooped out my brain, iPhone, and did an extensive research. I came up with Amelies French Bakery that had a location near us and several others in Charlotte. I GPS'd to their Carmel location and put the emergency blinkers on as I waited outside while the crew were inside filling up boxes. When they came, I took pictures that looked pretty good. Little did I know my tongue hitting my head may cause a concussion when I took a taste of the first sample and I thought I was in France as they were so good!!! If you are looking for sickening sweet desserts, this is not for you. If you like European sweetness, Soda City can't compete!!! I knew something was up as I saw so many people coming out with boxes!!! The only error was my Son told them not to torch the top of his cream brulee. He said he wouldn't turn it down again."

This girl wasn't happy she had to wait, so she just grabbed a paper towel to clean her hands dry; no water no soap,no sanitizer.  We ran out of the bathroom after her to see what was she will do.  To our surprise she went back to  rolling and cutting dough without gloves and no washing her hands.  This is totally unacceptable.  If you work in a restaurant take your time to wash your hands.

Having lived in Bordeaux some years ago as an expatriot, I miss the French pasteries from time to time, and Amelie's satisfies that longing.  On this visit, my order was a few specialties for take home which included the plain croissants (authentic in my view!), eclairs, lemon macarons, and a chocolate mousse (fluffy and tastful).\nOrdering has been streamlined - on reaching the head of the line, there is an associate there at all times to take your order at left of the counter. If you are ordering pastries to go, another associate works with you to complete your order.\nThe wait was short at 5 min considering there were 12 people in line and it was a busy Sunday. Service was friendly and attentive.\nIn a future visit, plans are to dine here which can be indoors or on the covered patio on the right side of the cafe."

It still comes out cold. Last time I was here, the manager was nice enough to replace my meal and refunded the French dip. I came back again and still the same cold sandwich. I didn't say anything this time because what's the point? I dont want my money back, just some hot food. I'll just have to take the extra couple of minutes and drive to the Noda location."

Also, it didn't have ganache or mousse on the inside--just frosted between layers with the same frosting. There were no chocolate curls, instead little mini chocolate chips which kept rolling of the plate.  I've had good cakes from this location before, so I expected a lot more. It needed the mousse to offset the bitter dark chocolate taste. It crumbled when cut into. NO one finished their piece. Sad."

            "review_text": "I wrote a good review last year, but I have to agree with another reviewer who said that the offerings and quality on some of the bakery items have dwindled.  Like her,  I also visited about three months ago, and a few times since then, and the cases were practically empty.  I asked the employee if they sold out because of the holiday.  I was told that they were in the process of hiring three more bakers.  Lately, the cases seem to have a few more items than in the recent past.  It's not uncommon for me to take home an Amelie's shopping bag filled with boxes of pastries. However, the last two times I purchased the Strawberry Petit Gateaux, there was no cream filling!  The chantilly cream is the best part, but it was cake on top of cake!  TWICE!!! And I have to mention that the first time, the cake was dry.  Also, although the Mirror tart is delicious, it used to be so pretty with the swirl of chocolate ganache on top.  Now, the ganache is just spread on top and looks very plain.  I had lunch with my son there also, and we were both looking forward to having the Asparagus and Leek soup.  I told my son that it looked like they forgot to add the cream, and there was no flavor, as if they added unsalted broth and forgot the seasonings. The sandwiches on the croissants were good, though.  I have great memories of visiting the Flagship store in NoDa. That's where I was introduced to all the good food and pastries. The Carmel Commons location is closer to home for now.  I hope they can replicate the quality of the flagship store one day!"

And 3rd time this morning where i asked 3 girls at the registers if they could break big bills and was told yes, they took the money and then i had to wait  15 for a manager to get change and then was told  by the manager that they dont accept big bills until after lunchtime which doesnt cater to early bird customers.

The sandwiches we ordered were great, the $50 cake we pre-ordered and picked up was not. It looked fantastic until we cut into it, and then the whole thing started crumbling to pieces. The \"buttercream\" frosting was weird and cracked into pieces when we tried to cut it. We had a baker in the family that said they must have made the cake earlier in the week and frozen it (not surprising since they don't have a baker anymore). Not what I'd expect for $50. We won't be back to this location; hopefully they haven't let their other location fall apart like this one."

Still, definitely looking forward to go again."

Mochas are darker like European versions rather than the typical sweeter American style  The real stars are the fresh pastries. Amelie's reminded me why people like macarons (small, colorful French cookie in multiple flavor options) since regular store-bought options are dry and bland. These are fresh and delicious! I also love their coconut macaroons... try both! Unlike the Uptown site, though, the staff wasn't especially friendly today. They also didn't ask light roast vs dark roast and didn't offer cream or sweetener, requiring another wait in the line. They weren't rude, exactly, just distracted I guess. I assume it was just the day since Uptown staff was regularly positive and friendly. Coffee and food were great as usual though."
