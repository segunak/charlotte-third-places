Jill (hope the names is correct) was very very kind and with Ela (hope I got the name correct) they made feel at home even if I just moved here from Europe. Breakfast was damn good, prepared with love. Toasted bread, superior bacon and the best scrambled eggs in my life. 100% sure. Coffee of course. The place is so nice I think I already found one of my \"posti del cuore\"."

I wasn't sure if this would work with a gift card, so we ordered when we got there. They also have an outdoor patio that had no one on it so we ate there.  I really wanted to try the pastrami or reuben sandwich, but they were out of both. We ended up going with the Smoked Salmon Bagel, BLT, and Tuna Melt.  The Tuna Melt was hands down my favorite. It was actually my first time trying a tuna melt. I loved the horseradish on it. I think that made the sandwich. The BLT was also great. The bacon was thick cut and delicous.  I wasn't a fan of the Smoked Salmon Bagel. The salmon was fully cooked which I'm not used to when the menu says it's cooked. It was also pretty fishy. If they replaced it with a more raw version of smoked salmon, I'm sure I would love it.  If you're looking for an awesome neighborhood sandwich shop, look no further than this place."

Both delicious and amazing sandwich ideas! My only recommendation would be to allow the brie to melt more on the turkey sandwich and to go lighter on the cream cheese on the salmon sandwich. Maybe these are just personal preferences and surely something a customer could request! I'll definitely be going back to try another sandwich soon. The outdoor seating was really cute too and I loved how they had Tay Flower plants for sale around the shop. There was lots to look at while waiting for your food. Also side note: They should consider adding a chipotle melt sandwich to the menu."

The pastrami is the best you'll find in the area, hands down (I could go on about this for awhile, but just go try it and see). They have a good selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages and the atmosphere is very welcoming. I highly recommend this place for a good sammy and beer. I haven't tried the breakfast or coffee yet, but I'm sure that's amazing too. Also, try the meat and cheese plate, buffalo chicken dip, and pimento cheese!"

            "review_text": "We recently moved to Charlotte from Massachusetts. Found this gem when we lost power in our neighborhood and I had to work from Advent Coworking which is next door, for 2 days. Best thing that came from losing power. First: the food here is amazing. I had a BLT, the bacon is out of this world. Next day, husband had to see what the hype was about. He went with the Pastrami, which he described as best he's ever had. I had the Grilled cheese: cheddar and swiss on wheat bread: delicious. Coffee is just as good. Candied bacon is also amazing. Had to go back and purchase some to go. Oh yea, they make and sell their own bacon which is thick, crunchy deliciousness along with other meat items. Day 3 had to make the drive and go back: daughter had a grilled cheese and I had a caramel latte, which was better than any chain I've had. I convinced myself there is not one bad item on their menu, everything is delicious. They also sell other items, a bit of everything. Few craft beers, personal items, good candy selection, different breads, etc. I can go on and on about this place. Then there's the service, the staff is so friendly and nice. The owner Amanda is hands down the nicest person we've met so far since moving to NC. She makes you feel right at home the minute you walk in, despite currently only open for takeout and pickup due to pandemic. She is so genuine, and warm. Great representation of Charlotte. Its so obvious she takes pride in her food, she supports local vendors, truly shows she cares for others and about the community. Cant wait to be able to dine in once pandemic is over. This will be our regular go to spot, nice indoor and outdoor seating area. It is definitely worth the drive, no matter the distance. You will not be disappointed."
