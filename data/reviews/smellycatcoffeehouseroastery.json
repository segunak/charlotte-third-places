Also one of the doors is just locked unless an employee lets you in but the one next to the parking lot (not the sidewalk) is unlocked? It's just odd. Also, why should you have to order outside if you're going to go sit inside? However if you want to sit outside it also works well with the order and pickup windows preventing too much congestion in one area. Food items are overpriced but the drinks are standard pricing and tasty so not much of a complaint there."

We saw a woman carrying a tablet who took another table of people inside, so we thought we just had to wait for her to come back out to seat us. She never did. We went up to a window to ask what we needed to do. That guy told us to go up to the other window, skip the line, and tell them we had a reservation. I did that. The person at that window said we needed to wait in line, order our food, and then we'd be let inside. What was the point of having a reservation if we had to be in the same line as everyone else? When we finally got inside, my friend received her food and coffee, and I didn't receive mine. My friend sat there not eating until an employee walked by and asked why she wasn't enjoying her food. That was the only reason I ever even got my food. The breakfast burrito was tiny, but the coffee was good. We walked down the street and got Reigning Doughnuts immediately afterward because we were still hungry. All in all, it was a disappointing stop. Love the coffee mural on the side of the building though!"

The espresso was sitting in a paper cup waiting to come out with the pour overs that were still not done. When I reminded them that the espresso was supposed be in a ceramic cup, the took the old espresso and dumped it in a ceramic cup. It was cold and no good- a waste of money.

They had only made us one, so we asked for the second. The server stared at us blankly like he had stopped functioning, literally saying nothing. After awkward silence, we asked again and were told we'd have to get back in line—which was 16 people long at this point due to the “iPad issue”—and order again. No thanks.  To make sure we hadn't paid for the second drink, I asked for a receipt. He said he could only text or email it, so I gave my phone number. Realizing that he was only pretending to take down the number, probably assuming I'd be walking away, I told him I'd wait at the window until it came through. Then, he got a pen and asked for the number again. What respectable service. 👏🏼  The one drink was good, so I'll give them a second star for that, but the service is clearly lacking."

(25$ btw) Got the coffees right away and it was BAD.  It was very bitter and we didn't even get half way through before throwing them away. They made us step aside for the food so that they can serve the customers behind us in line.  Well we waited… and waited… and there was no indication our food was done other than the fact that people that stood behind us in line were getting their complete order and no one ever said anything to us.  We went back to barista at the window that had our food sitting behind her the entire time!! Halfway back to the car we realized we were missing half of the order so we had to walk all the way back (parking was full so we were 2 blocks away.) luckily the quiche was actually pretty tasty so they mildly redeemed themselves.  Over all, not a great experience.  This is a place where if you judge it by it's cover it should be good but in reality the looks surpass the quality.  Go to Amelie's instead."

The shop has a great atmosphere both inside and out. Plenty of people hanging out in the patio areas, which were on the front, side and in the back under a big tree. My wife had a chai tea which was ok but didn't have the kick she was expecting for a chai. I had a mocha frappe which was good but the roasted coffee flavor was very strong making it unbalanced. I had hoped they had some sugar free offerings in their syrups, but the only thing they had were some sugar free teas. We also had a piece of zucchini bread which was pretty good. Overall I'd give it a 3.5."

Almost everything on the menu is made in house, from the coffee roasting to the baked goods. Everything I had was delicious and the staff was inviting and welcoming. They even asked how our latte was when we went to order seconds. Also if you are visiting with a dog there is a side window to order and plenty of outdoor seating. Thank you so much for the amazing food and vibe! Definitely a highlight of our stay in Charlotte."

They make the best iced dirty chai I've bought.They're breakfast burritos are also always a solid choice. A few of my other favorites from here include the vanilla latte and their iced Americano.  The employees are always friendly. They've got a nice chill atmosphere, both indoor seating (when it's allowed) and outdoor seating. I love that they're locally owned and roast their beans. This was a regular place to visit when I lived in Charlotte and I still make sure to stop in anytime I'm near Noda."

Outdoor seating is enough to appease the crowds and the wait time is minimal, not to mention there's free wifi. I recommend looking at their specialty menu, the alcoholic drinks are awesome! Didn't even taste too strong like other drinks I've tried. The parking is usually ok but keep in mind they close kinda early and will close off the parking lot by 5pm. Overall great spot for some affordable tasty coffee."

It was so nice to find out that they kept it open after Richard passed a few years ago. I would suggest anything they have to offer. From pastries to coffee and beer and some wines, you can't beat their price. My over all favorite is their sledgehammer. A shot of their house made espresso with a little chocolate.  It give just the right sweetness but with the true taste of the coffee bean. Not to mention, the smelly cat is names as you've guessed it, from Phoebe from Friends and her song \" smelly cat\" it's definitely an on the list of things to see in NODA."

It's located in the NoDa neighborhood in Charlotte and is very charming and quirky. The coffee house has seating in the front, side of building and inside. The inside is decorated in this rustic farmhouse vibe and is a very cozy space. They have a few nooks inside for seating two.  The barista that served my friend and I was very pleasant and patient with us. It was our first visit so it took us a moment to decide on our drink of choice  for the hot and humid Sunday afternoon.  I ended up ordering an ice latte with toasted coconut syrup and almond milk. I took a sip and thought, man oh man, this is a good cup of coffee. The coffee had a smooth and bright flavor, no bitter taste. This would definitely be my go to coffee shop if I lived here. Great coffee, funky atmosphere and good service - love it!"

Everyone was fine with him being there, there were no issues whatsoever until an employee (who didn't look like an employee at all) walked in and told us passive aggressively to get our dog out of the store unless he was a service dog so we left for a few minutes. My husband came in about 5 minutes later to grab a Dixie sized cup of water for our dog and aparently since we left for all of five minutes we're \"no longer customers\" and couldn't get a Dixie sized cup of water that doesn't cost them hardly anything, according to the same girl. I actually would consider coming back if it weren't for her, she was rude and obviously in a bad mood and if that's the way they treat customers I want nothing to do with it. Thanks but no thanks. Don't consider bringing your dog in, especially if they're small and harmless."

My favorite thing about Smelly Cat is that (someone correct me if I'm wrong) all the tea and coffee is organic and the syrups are made from pure cane sugar. They roast their own beans and you can tell someone put a lot of love in the drinks. The barista are always really friendly people who don't mind my weird order, and the shop is small and interesting. The only thing that is really disappointing is the parking situation. It's extremely cramped and near impossible for my Toyota Tundra to even fit in a parking space. We can't even go on some days because of it being so crowded with not enough space. Since we drive 30 minutes just to get there, it's important that we have somewhere we can actually park once we get there! Still, if I want coffee, this is where I go."

The girl who helped us was very sweet and welcomed us, and mentioned that their Chai Tea Latte was pretty tasty. Chai Tea Latte's are one of my favourite drinks and so of course I wanted to give this one a try. My friend and I both ordered one, and when one of the staff members brought it to us at our table (which was also really nice!), we were both really impressed! We will definitely come back here. The atmosphere was very cozy and welcoming. Board games are available for you to play with whoever you happen to be with!. We brought our own deck of cards so we played that for a while and a group behind us was playing a Harry Potter board game! Felt like I was at a peaceful family get together. Haha! All in all a really great experience - I've recommended this to basically all of my friends. The location is wonderful as well! Easy to just step out and walk around NoDa area and explore a bit. The only downfall (if you choose to see it that way) is parking! Both times I came here, I had to park a little ways away. Maybe it was because I didn't look hard enough? I didn't mind though. I enjoyed the entire experience!"
