It was re-built during the pandemic, and so the new design is specifically geared towards the pandemic condition. They have installed a bunch of rooms where there used to be open space, so that people can better isolate themselves from others. This also makes the library feel cramped, even though its a huge building. The lovely garden on the downstairs patio is now gone, and they have left only a tiny fraction of space for a new garden. The children's area is likewise now cramped and has hardly any open space."

Social distancing is in place as even though at the time that I visited it was only myself and two other people in there and I only was in there all of 10mins. They have self checkout and if you need to use the computer to print since they are in Level 2 status right now there is no fee to print and they will give you a guest pass to do so, so you will only really need your library card to scan to check out 📚. Would highly recommend this library without any reservations to you and your family!✨"

They seemed uninterested in helping the public, and I had to point out how one could use the non-resident card (you CAN check out regular books with it, no matter what they say) to the staff at the circulation desk. Customer service was nonexistent, which surprised me, because it was everything at the small rural library system I worked at. Their books were poorly shelved, which was disappointing for such a large library. The children's area was nice, but I really didn't feel comfortable with the children's librarians scowling at me. If I felt that way as a 37 year old woman, I can only imagine how the kids must feel. No one feels approachable here. Honestly, I bought the non-resident card to get access to a larger amount of books, but from here on out, I'll only visit the library to pick up holds. I won't come here to spend some time, we'll go to our own dinky library for that. At least the people at ours seem happy to see us."

They were having a good time playing with the hand puppets and got a little too excited and started chasing each other in a circle in a small area- again in the KID'S section. An older woman who worked there quickly came over and started scolding the kids for running and saying \"if you need to run so bad have your parents take you to the park\" mind you it was about to storm outside but that's besides the point. Basically, yes they should not have been running and yes a library is not a place for that kind of play but the librarian could have at least given them a warning first before the harsh words or picked a nicer approach to her message such as letting the parents know they need to settle down. These kids were all under the age of 5. Will not be returning."
