(I came 7/25/24 at 9:15am, if you want to tell the young guy with dark hair that took my order to get his ears checked). I absolutely hate vanilla. I tried it, and it tasted very fake, barely masking the hydrogenated soy bean oil in it. I tried a bit on the top, and it was so gross that I just threw it away. We ordered in, and my drink came in a to go cup, and my friend's came in an actual glass. There goes getting any actual cute photos. Make up your mind. My friend ordered a hot chocolate, which wasn't bad, albeit plain all things considered. My chai latte was gross. It had almost no spices in it, which is why I suspect they put a ton of cinnamon on top, to try and mask this. It basically just tasted of steamed milk, which is freaking gross. I live in a pretty small city, and there is WAY better chai lattes there than this place. Waste of money.  Also, do something about the ants on your patio that are eating your customers when they sit outside."
