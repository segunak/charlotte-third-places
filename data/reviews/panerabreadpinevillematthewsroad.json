Sometimes you get rice that is a bit hard because it wasn't cooked all the way and the taste of the same foods is also inconsistent. I always put NO UTENSILS on my take out orders and yet I ALWAYS find utensils in my bag. Sometimes you don't even get baguettes or any sides with the order because they'd run out. Other times they run out of an ingredient for some dishes. The tea sometimes taste old like it's been refrigerated too long and lost its fresh tea taste or a bit watered do at times. again I have a year's worth of experience eating from here. It's good sometimes but lacks consistency. 2 stars because I like Panera in general."

Employees outside in front of the door smoking cigarettes very unprofessional customer service when I went in to get my chips the young girl behind the pickup Cafe had a horrible attitude and  threw  the chips on the counter. I did go back into speak with a manager. Young people if you're working in customer service please remember that customer service is the number one thing that you're supposed to have is excellent customer service enjoy helping others and serving others or get a new job. She also threw the top to my drink and instead of them having any small cups one of the guys handed me a coffee cup to fix my drink because he said they ran out of small cups so when I had to come back  to get a top the same rude little girl through the top on the counter thank God I'm saved Lord knows it's very sad how y'all young folk act today it's very sad and all I can do is say help your parents cuz I can only imagine what they go through someone so disrespectful on the job I can only imagine what you're like at home thank God you're not my child is all I can say today.

When I asked why my order was ready more than 30 minutes early, the response i got was we start web orders as soon as we get them. I produced a screen shot of my order details including pick up time. Again I was told that the web orders are started as received. I replied that I did not care about the internal processes and that I can reheat the food after i drove 15 minutes to my destination. I was there at 8;40 PM. I got an apology and an offer to remake anything that was not hot. Thats when I left. I am not going to unpack my order and taste test everything to make sure it was hot. It was made 30 minutes before the requested time. I have not been in a store or ordered for sometime due to Covid. Do not send me a pastry voucher I will not be back."

So she slurped it up before I could get home just to tell me her tummy hurt. My first reaction was to call them just to let them know and maybe throw it all out and not serve to any more children, however after listening to a never ending ring for over 10 minutes and then have my daughter throw it all up I just want someone to know. Check all their dates when purchasing from this location."

I showed them the confirmation on my phone and They promptly began to make a new order for me. Then they realize that my order must've been given or picked up by the wrong person because the cook had just made it. While I was waiting for them to make the new order they came out and brought me some free pastries to take home and said sorry for the confusion & wait. I appreciated that very much. A lot of places don't do things like that to compensate anymore. It meant a lot to me and made the experience a positive one. The flat bread tasted wonderful. It's priced very fairly too as it was more than enough for two meals. Thank you Panera! I will gladly return to the Arboretum location!"

I ordered a pick 2 meal, and only got the cup of soup, my sandwich and side item were completely missing. When I realized this upon returning  home, I called to complain to the manager. He was unable to give me a refund over the phone since I paid in cash, so I was given the option to have a few Pick 2 coupons mailed to my house to make up for the missing items in my last meal. It's been almost 4 weeks and I've yet to receive a coupon. This is not the first time I've had food missing or gotten the wrong order completely.  It's very frustrating to continually have sloppy employees and even more frustrating to be promised compensation and never get it. I work in the same shopping center, but now I go out of my way to order from other locations. This one is always disappointing."

There are some locations like the store 3207 Pineville-Matthews Rd, Charlotte, NC 28226 where the management and the staff like the cashier Ms. Makayla Meeks can change your not so good day to a superb day!!  The way employees greet the customer I believe is very important and help businesses to bring the customer back. This employee of Panera Bread gives you the smile and warm welcome on every visit, and ensure that you are happy with the order.  Unfortunately too many people are working as store managers, but how many of these people know the importance of customer service, and reward their employees."

I used to get it right at the counter but now it gets toasted, sits a bit, so it loses both the toastedness and warmth of the bagel until it is delivered.  I would be more satisfied waiting the 39 seconds to have it toasted at the counter.

When my husband picked up the order the manager refused to speak with him and gave us no gift card. His employees shared that he also treats them poorly - shocking! His excuse by phone was they were busy, but I called from 2:15 - 2:35 without anyone picking up and when my husband walked in the place was empty.

At 12:12 PM I received a text notifying me that my order was on its way and my driver was Kevin. At 1:05 PM I still had not received my order so I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager, David, just to see about how long it would be so I could plan for it. He apologized and said he would get in touch with Kevin and find out where he was at. At 1:33 PM I called back and spoke to David again and told him to just cancel my order because I had to get back to work. He apologized again and said he would get it canceled for me but made no attempt to correct the situation at all. Very disappointed in the service at this location and that I wasted my lunch break waiting for my order.  Edit: Because I had to close the office at my job that night, I decided to reorder online for my dinner since I did not have lunch. I chose the 4:00-4:15 PM delivery time and it arrived on time and Kevin apologized for what had happened with my first order. He said he was the only delivery driver and had several orders to deliver around lunch time so he got behind. Understandable, but it would have been nice to have been notified by the manager when I called the first time, that they were running behind."
