My husband got a regular drip coffee which tasted like nothing. I ordered an Americano with sugar free vanilla. I watched the barista pour wayyy too much syrup in the cup (I was a barista for 5 years so I have a good idea about how much goes in a 16oz cup) and then watched 2 or 3 more drinks that were ordered after me get made and handed out before mine. They were relatively busy, with a line of 3 people pretty consistently, so I don't mind waiting for my coffee in those situations. However, the drink was so gross it didn't redeem the wait. I had my husband try it to make sure I wasn't being overly critical and he suggested I throw it away. We left and tossed our drinks and went to another coffee shop. Won't be visiting this spot again."

First incident was with a blond girl wearing a hoodie with a rainbow at the front counter; second incident was with a black man at the front counter.  Problem A: Both times when I asked for my drink of choice (\"Could I have a ____\") they responded with something to the rude tune of \"Yeah no.\" The second encounter I was thrown off by how dismissive he was; both times they just kept staring at me like I was the one who was foolish. How am I supposed to know what's out of stock? That's your job to inform me, do so respectfully, and perhaps offer a suggestion. So instead had to re-pivot and offer a second choice, without any input from them. Again just poor customer service based on their reactions.  Problem B: In that second incident, after I ordered, I moved to the right to wait for my order; a customer came over afterward and told me she had heard the blond girl and black man (at the front counter) talking smack about me. They were condescending to what I was wearing and how I wasn't entertaining their flippant manner with my demeanor.  Seriously have these two ever gone through customer service training? How can the Marriott endorsement this terrible behavior? The baristas here used to be so sweet (one used to remember my name) and now they're moody, condescending, and just awful to deal with. Will happily take my money to Night Swim or the cafe in the Ritz. Bye bye."

Wasn't much in the way of food but they had plenty of beer and a good selection of coffee. Ordered a chocolate muffin as well, waited 10 minutes before anyone said anything to me (mind you it took close to 5 just for the latte and there was one couple in front of me). The guy who asked had just gotten there while the guy who took my order was ready to leave but got told to clean lids and straws.  The environment is cool and plenty of seating. A very relaxed vibe. But the tables near the window hadn't been cleaned.  It's in a great location, especially for people at the Marriott, but not worth more than one visit.  Also...$15 for a French press!?"

The decor is warm and inviting, while still being trendy and fun. Every place invites a different vibe. There's spots where you can be productive while enjoying their coffee, or snuggle up with your honey and share a croissant. The bench along the windows facing the street is heated, and for someone as cold-natured as me, that immediately became my favorite spot. I loved it so much, I brought my partner back today. He got the house coffee and is still singing its praises. The bacon egg and cheese croissant was devoured in short order. I got an iced mocha that's delicious, and a smoothie (the Pitaya Pick-me-up, I think it was called?) It was fantastic and the next time we're in Charlotte I really want to come back and try out more of the menu- including the daily sandwich, which sadly wasn't starting until noon so we missed out. :("

Apparently you can also reserve the larger tables on the hotel-side of the shop. Those are tucked away in the back, if you will. Really inviting and work centric vibe. If you aren't motivated this place will get you there!  Its attached to the Marriott so that is ideal as the location is downtown and on street parking is hard to find. Free wifi. Good coffee.

Puerto Rico, Oregon, Florida, Kentucky and North Carolina just to name a few but I've never tasted such a malty, creamy and decadent coffee like the one in Coco and the Director. Last time I went I actually ended up drinking 2 cups of coffee it was so good. Granted I was wired for about 24 straight hours but well worth the jitter-pumped-caffeine-infuse-hardcore hangover. If there's a better coffee than this one please  by all means tell me so I could try it because this is at the top of my list.  The location of the store and the setup is beyond what you can imagine. Big stair-like steps adorn the main lounge where you can sit and drink your coffee but there are pillows you actually sit on or use them for your back. Not your thing? Ok, no prob. There are tables throughout the whole location to maintain the traditional way of drinking \"un cafecito\" in the coffee shop.  The staff are all super friendly and very knowledgeable of the coffee and where it comes from. They are so friendly, in my opinion, that they're the type of people I'd like to have as friends.  Wait for me because I'll be returning soon to order my two cups of coffee. Or better yet, prepare me my 32 oz jug because I'm ready for more! Keep up the excellent work or great products and great service, every single time."

They have interesting (although expensive) items for out-of-towners looking to get something local. The seating is fabulous. There is a book trade, and great windows for people watching.  There are lots of plugs throughout so you could stay all day if you wanted to...  The staff is great every time I go in. Overall I love this place!"

This place is more about the decor than the service or their food and beverage offerings. Each time the service is just a little too slow for a coffee shop or the pastry is lackluster. The coloring and wine night is a cool idea and there is nothing better than hanging out in a coffee shop drinking wine. Problem is pour size varies greatly by the staff member and even then sometimes the same person has wildly different size pours. Go for the atmosphere, but don't expect to be blown away by anything else. Really it's just a good place to hang out."
