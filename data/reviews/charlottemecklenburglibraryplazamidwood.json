I've been in Charlotte for a little over 30 years now, even before this library opened & I've always loved the area before that. I started using this one again about two years ago when I figured this one was easiest for me to get to even though Independence Regional is closer (I don't drive right now. Plus, I like hanging out at the Harris Teeter across the street). The librarians are always nice & helpful when I need to ask a question. Easy for me to find what I need because it's not a huge library but still enough space to be comfortable, even during this tough time we're in. Plaza Midwood and Independence Regional are both favorites for me."

I saw a cotckrarch the other morning, and then I figured out why, they allowed you to eat, no small snacks and soft drinks with caps to keep your drink safe of split it, they allowed fast food, which is very nasty seeing grease fingers prints on the tables and keyboards, plus all those fast food smells mix in the air, people eating like if they are actually in the fast food place, impossible to concentrate, come on, is a library not a mall or park. Finally, in the restroom we saw a small empty liquor bottle and a used razor, that's dangerous."
