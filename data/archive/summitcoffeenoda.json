The staff was really friendly, but the latte was just straight up bad. I'm not sure what happened or if this is just how it always tastes, but I got a hot PSL and it was insanely watered down. I ordered it with whole milk, and it tastes like it was made with a mix of skim and water. Plus there didn't seem to be much espresso in there. It tasted like half a shot for the 12oz of “milk”? This was the worst latte I've ever had in my life. I wasted $6 on this and it was still worth it to toss it out. When I was pouring it down the sink too it even looked super watery. Not sure what the hype is about, but save yourself $7 and try another coffee shop or make it at home. I can seriously make a better tasting latte at home with my Nespresso."

The workers were kind which is why I even gave 2 stars. The atmosphere is strange here. They have dark occult art on the wall, which doesn't complement the aesthetic unless they are communicating their love for the occult (I did not appreciate the workers' conversations making fun of their moms' love for Jesus).  One piece of \"art\" that was particularly uncomfortable to look at was the one on the center of the wall. It had the word MISANTHROPE, which means to hate mankind, and also the words 'city of fools.'  The chai tea I ordered was not flavorful but watery; it tasted like warm cinnamon water. Also tried a lemonade matcha, but that tasted like a lemon Le Croix.  I cannot recommend this place at all."
