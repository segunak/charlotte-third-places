Our drinks were ready quickly and were the perfect temperature to drink right away‚Äîvery warm, but not burn your tongue hot.  There was a perfectly delicious hint of cookie butter and the chai was delicious. It wasn't the overly sweet stuff you find at a lot of places. You'll find a spicy, flavorful chai here.  I'll definitely stop by again sometime!"

The coffee shop was quite busy, but I only had to wait a few minutes for my drink. I received my latte, made by Scott, and it was delicious. He was friendly as well.

The atmosphere is great, the staff is awesome, and the prices are surprisingly decent. However, almost every coffee that I've ordered, hot or cold, has had almost no taste to it whatsoever. I do not put much dairy in my coffee to begin with, but I always ask them to go light because of this, and even then my drinks still barely taste like coffee. If they can figure out how to make some stronger coffee and/or fix the coffee-to-milk ratio, I'll gladly bump this up to 5 stars."

This place inspired me to try something new, their Lavender Latte is so delicious and my husband is obsessed with their Turmeric Ginger Chai. The staff are all friendly and truly accommodating. They are also doing a great job supporting their community during the current pandemic. I will be back as often as possible and highly recommend to anyone willing to listen."

I had been wanting to check this place out for awhile since I'd seen it because it looked so cute, and quaint, and like it would be make a nice cuppa joe.  Alas! I came in and it was pretty busy, waited in the long line, and the staff was really nice, making jokes and greeting people warmly as they walked up to order and calling out the drinks that were ready.  I ordered a simple espresso as I figured a place like this would make a great one. Sadly, that was not my experience. My espresso was way too acidic to the point of being almost undrinkable and it was a little burnt. Not sure if they were just having an off day or if I got some leftover espresso from a previous order or what the deal was, but for the price and atmo and other reviews, I expected so much better and was so disappointed!  Needless to say, I don't see myself coming back, at least not for awhile to get both the figurative & literal \"bad taste out of my mouth\".  1-star for the coffee but 4 stars for the service and decor. However, being the coffee junkie that I am, I should never like a coffee place's service & decor way better than their actual coffee (insert sad face here)"
