I ordered a latte and a chorizo taco. It's pretty popular here, so the wait was longer than I had expected, but once they arrived, it was top notch all the way around. The latte was smooth with a slightly bitter kick, just the way I like. The taco was a good size for the price, and the chorizo, while a bit greasy, was popping with flavor and blended well with the egg and cheese, and the tortilla was quite enjoyable as well.  Definitely a good place to stop for coffee in south end!"

Chips and queso wasn't bad, but the chips were definitely over salted.  Vibe was cool, beer was good, made some new friends. Had a great time. Probably about 10 it started picking up and by 11 there was a line out the door.  <>  Also been here once before with the drinking crowd and it was alright. Certainly a crowded place, but I found I prefer coming here when it isn't super loud. It's a good “pregame” place for me."

Once inside, you enter the land of try hards and ballers on a budget. Cocktails are about as good as one could make themselves and their liquor selection was nonexistent. The only reason this place got 2 instead of 1 star is because the bartender was very friendly. Don't come here. Don't waste your money.

The security escalated a small situation to a much larger situation and continued to try to kick the males from our group out.

The guy patrolling the corridor from the useless hostess stand to the back to the bar is the rudest server I've encountered in south end in 5 years. Told us to move 5 feet away and then told us that wasn't where he wanted us to go 🙄 boy make up your mind??"

First off, the Event Manager Emily Cole is a dream to work with. She was so accommodating and was present the entire day for any questions or requests. We also had to reschedule last minute due to Covid, and she helped us reschedule with ease. 2. The new space is also BEAUTIFUL and lively and fun. We booked the private room, which was spacious and had a ton of natural light. They had a really cool drink ordering system that brought us drinks so we didn't have to wait in line at the bar. 3. Drinks and food were great. This isn't shocking coming from Resident Culture. 4. There's a beautiful event space coming downstairs for any brides looking to get married in South End!  Looking forward to making this a regular spot. We will definitely look to book another event there soon. Thank you Emily and Resident Culture!"

Everyone is having a good time dancing , drinking , socializing, eating tacos( Toro buto) or all of the above. Also, they have a movable POS which is nice for processing customers fast.  You have to be 21+ to get in (at night) . There's enough room for everyone. They have tables on the main floor , at the back of the main floor and outdoor sitting too. Going to the restroom, they have a Disco ball spinning that's pretty cool. The DJ is on point with the music selection . Menu of their drinks on the TV. I'll say it like a mini optimist Hall but without the multiple food outlets. Overall, great experience. It's a spot to chill let loose with great friends."

When we were able to go in, it was quite busy inside with not enough seating. However the decorations are quite modern and colorful.  The taco place was hard to find as there isn't obvious signage and there is no physical place to order. You have to order through their website/QR code. They text you when your order is ready, but it wasn't obvious, so I thought I might have missed my order. It took about 40 minutes to receive my food after ordering. The tacos are really really good though. They're about $3.50 each and are just solid street tacos.  The wait for the beer wasn't too bad, but I did see long lines later in the night. There's one main bar and a smaller bar towards the back. I ordered a Mexican lager and it was pretty good standard beer.  We luckily found a table, but I experienced sensory overload. There was a lot of people, but the acoustics of the place amplified the sound. The colorful decorations could also be much after a while. I recommend going when it is not busy if you are sensitive to loud sounds and colors/lights. The wait staff was attentive and the place itself was clean.  Overall, a nice addition to the breweries in South end!"
