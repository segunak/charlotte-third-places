Of course we ordered the Chicken Biscuit and also got a side of the cheesy grits which were PHENOMENAL. Coffees were also great during the cold rainy day we were having. Also got some little treats that were displayed at the front register area. What I wasn't a fan of was the service. No one greeted us when we walked in (except the fellas in the back by the beer) and upon reviewing the menu, my partner and I felt rushed and as if we were an inconvenience.  No one came to see if we needed anything our entire meal and no one attempted to tell us to have at the least a \"day\" when we left. Overall....would I visit again? For the food - Yes!! but if I have the same rude vibes, it will more than likely be the last time."

Love the string lights. There was a band playing as party of Suffolk Punch's Daydream Music Fest.  We ordered through a QR code on our table. Service was so quick!!  Here's what I tried: - Grains and Things ($16): Large portion. Loved the ingredients. But the chicken was a little difficult to cut and there was too much goat cheese for my taste. Still good though! - Fungus Among Us ($16): OMG. So much flavor. So delicious. - Crispy Brussels ($6): Good! - Mac-N-Cheese ($6): Yummmm, currently craving this.  Suffolk Punch was awesome! Good for groups, date night, anything! Highly recommend!"

You get to order through an app and keep your tab open. Beers come out within a minute or too which is really impressive considering how busy it is. The food is a little pricy, but it's really good. We had the spinach artichoke dip which I really recommend, the thai chili flat bread, and the burger. Pay attention to the menu because the carmalized onion jam has strawberries. I also super appreciate the compostable cutlery. The beer was really good as well. The IPAs as well as the seltzers and the frozen slushie drinks. Not really a bad thing to say!"

Some lacked a welcoming personality. Trevor was the bright spot of the bunch. When weather permits, the outside patio with dedicated bar works great. Very nice coffee bar is a plus.

The environment of the back patio reminded me of a busy cafeteria- loud, hot mayhem. Service was not particularly memorable as you had to scan a QR code and order from your phone- someone would later drop off your order with minimal acknowledgement. I mention this because the brunch wasn't cheap and patrons are often times going to restaurants such as these in part for the experience. The food itself was decent, but nothing I'd return for. The drinks looked like something you might order at a beach bar- no care really taken in making them. Sadly, I don't know that'd return. At least not on a Sunday afternoon."

I was seated near the kitchen and had a perfect view of the area food is picked up from and delivered to tables. I observed a few of the women playing with/adjusting their hair and then grabbing plates to deliver it to tables. I observed one man that took his hat off adjusted it and put it back on right over the food holding area. These individuals did not wash or sanitize at all. The servers are responsible for adding fries that are held in a bowl to the plates. Because of their lack of cleanliness this was not well received. My food was just ok. My fries were overcooked and just warm. My burger appeared to have unknown particles, thinner than hair so I don't think that's what is was. My friend described her French toast muffin as very bad and something they should rework. It completely fell apart and was very soggy. Our server was nice but the hostess instructed us to wait at the to go ordering area. When someone came he told us to go to the hostess stand. She then said she thought we were ordering to go, not sure why she assumed that or at the least just asked. The best part was the cold brew cocktails, they were very good but would not make me return. Glad I went, now I know."

She was very attentive and constantly checked on us. I had a couple beers, and a shot of Bourbon along with a pretzel. I really loved the vibe they had here, the music playlist was amazing. Restrooms were clean and all staff wore masks while I was there.  I highly recommend stopping by, they're right on the blue line which makes it convenient if you have a few too many......  Sadly I didn't take the time to get photos, so you'll just have to go for yourself 😁"

Limited parking, so highly recommend the Blue Line light rail as there is a stop a couple hundred feet from this area that houses a couple different breweries. Was a bit disappointed in a couple of the seasonal drafts being out and it isn't even the middle of the month, yet. Still, there were some good selections of beer, cocktails and wine. The food is good and the queso served with blue chips has their own pineapple salsa on top that is very good. Definitely one place to visit again, but next time, take the Light Rail. Great outdoor seating area, too."

Parking is craaazy, arrive at 10am if you can. The venue is beautiful on the inside, and it smells amazing. We didn't wait long, 20 minutes. Our table was dirty when they sat us down , which is a bummer for me because I'm big on cleaning. The man was kind about it and quickly wiped it down ( with a dingy wash rag looking thing ). Our waitress was very short with us, un-atentive and seemed bothered by something. We had to ask several times for basic things such as napkins and forks , extra plates.  Chicken buiscut was dry,  the buiscut itself was delicious,  the gravy was delicious but the chicken was so dry. The potatoes were seasoned well, nice crisp 👌.  The French toast was soooo good 👍 😋!!!! The mimosa was very much just orange juice 👎 👎 👎. Menu was veeeeery limited for they were shortstaffed in the kitchen. As was explained to us.  I'll return in a few weeks give them another try,  as long as I font get that waitress"

Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. We enjoyed a number of drinks and they were all delicious. My eyes were bigger than my stomach. Each portion is a LOT so be aware of that when ordering for the table. I ate so many apps that I could barely eat my pizza. The chicken wings were fried perfectly and seasoned/sauced just right. You couldn't eat them without making a mess and we were completely fine making that mess. The cauliflower app was also very tasty. My pizza was topped with too many things so the middle was soggy and liquid-y. That would have been the only feedback from our evening there.

Good amount of beers available and they have decent wine. The food is nice too, the ham pinino  and the veggie burger were tasty.  You can be sat inside, quite cool, or sit outside on your own.  If you go outside you have to order at the counter on the side.  You wait for the drinks near by but the bring the food out for you.  Overall quite pleasant."

They used to host Robot Johnson comedy shows in an event space they unfortunately got rid of. Their lack of prep and staffing those nights gave me a good picture of the place. Was there tonight and although bars are allowed to stay open til 2 again, they chose to close at midnight. Alcohol can still be legally sold until 2 am. And legally sold alcohol in NC can be consumed until thirty minutes after close. They had muscleheads walking around kicking people out right at midnight who had full beverages. I informed them of the laws and they had some BS retort about private property as if liquor laws don't apply to every place that serves liquor. One guy claimed the restaurant angle and I've worked in a dozen restaurants in my time. It's not true. He was BSIng customers. I just... don't like this place. It's everything wrong with Charlotte."

I wish there was someone explaining how the restaurant works or at least better signage indicating how the service works. The staff could be more friendly too. Overall I'd return because of the food and ambiance. Also, we had ordered coffee with our food and never received our beverages. We had to go ask and then we were told we had to pick up with the barista. The communication between staff and customer was very poor and needs improvement."

She went to the bathroom with no issue and a bouncer comes over and threatens to kick us out. I explained it was not her being a drunken mess, but a stomach issue and that we would take care of it. He threatened us again and I explained to him again my wife was not feeling well and we would take care of it.

First, more vegan/vegetarian options please, it's 2019!! Second, it's super odd that there is no table service outside. Clearly a lot of time and money was spent constructing the garden farm tables and it's a big attraction of coming here. The waiters also seemed confused about how to handle people ordering food outside. Third, we came for breakfast today and they only had one food option, a ham and cheese sandwich. If you're going to pay staff to be open it makes sense to have a more comprehensive food menu. Again we love the concept, but hope these things can be improved to better the overall customer experience."

Nice restored building, combination of brick, iron and wood. Modern and rustic touches, lots of seating indoors and out. The staff was great, let us try some beers before ordering. I enjoyed there Ipa's and also their pilsner. We had some buffalo shrimp that were really good and hit the spot. We were there early on a Friday and it was not to crowded. There is a ton of apartments and condos in the area, I am sure it is packed evenings and weekends. Their beer is made on site, you can walk back and check on the large fermenters and brewing equipment. I believe they did offer tours. We took the tram so I can't comment about the parking. I really didn't see much but I have a feeling most people take public transportation or scooters. Those scooters are everywhere. It is family and pet friendly but not a lot for the kids to do. Their was a few corn hole boards and some room to roam around outside. Look forward to visiting again during our next stay in Charlotte."

The bar outside has limited beers, so we came back inside with hopes to find a spot at the bar. It was busy, which isn't their fault, but that did cause us to leave since we couldn't get a drink.

            "review_text": "Just to be clear, the food and drinks from Suffolk Punch are great, their customer service and event planning is one of the worst experiences I've ever had.  This place has been my new favorite go to spot for weekend brunch and craft beer, I've been coming here for months and the only complaint I've encountered is wait times on getting a table. Problem solved after finding the right times to go. While having brunch one day, my wife and I were party planning my daughters 2nd birthday when we came up with a brilliant idea, have the party at Suffolk Punch! Great food, drinks and plenty of space for guests. We inquired about it with our server and the hostess came by with their event planners information. The server and hostess showed us a great spot on the outside patio where we could have the party which sounded great until it became such a hassle trying to get ahold of their event planner. We sent multiple emails and called multiple times but she was never around. We were given the run around every time we followed up on an email to check our spam folder. FINALLY got ahold of their event planner a week before our planned party and was told she is no longer in that role and was not aware the staff was still giving out her name and information. When I asked for whoever the new event planner was, I was told they have not fulfilled that role yet. I was told a manager would reach out to me to help reserve a table, that call never came through. Luckily we had a plan B because no one from Suffolk Punch ever got back to us.  Revised review on 3/17/2019...  Spoke with the owner, he explained the event planner issue with me and understood my frustration and concern. He made things right and offered extraordinary hospitality during my next visit. I was very pleased and looking forward to my next visit to Suffolk Punch."

Love all the plants and beautiful booths/ tables etc. I ordered an Americano, which unfortunately was not the best-- seems simple to fix as it was sour so possibly the espresso machine just needs to be calibrated. Or it could be the type of coffee but I'm assuming they use Espresso blend. I would not order an espresso based beverage there again. My friend enjoyed the spiced latte and said that was very good. Our waiter was friendly and food came out in a reasonable time frame with a good presentation. I enjoyed the breakfast burrito-- salsa tasted very fresh and loved that it was the perfect size for a meal (no waste)! The tortilla itself could use a little work but everything else was very delicious. My friend had the veggie hash which was very beautiful and she said tasty. We went at 10:30 am and it was definitely more packed (including parking) by the time we left. So I recommend getting in early or be prepared to wait a bit."

The warm interior and wondeful menu made it a perfect place for a drink and an app. They have quite a selection of beers and wine, and a wonderful app of \"Frenched Wings\" that were so tasty, and perfect for (2) to share. The BBQ glaze and the Red Pickled Onion made it a culinary extravaganza. This is a lot to say about an app. The menu is all chef inspired and clean.

She gave honest recommendations on the food - she was not joking about the pimiento cheese - it was bomb!  Super knowledgeable about the beers on tap, and can recommend something based off of what you typically drink. Can be a bit slow when it comes to receiving food and drink, but it's worth it when your server is outstandingly nice. She definitely went over the top to make our experience wonderful.  She has promotion written all over her.  Absolute professional and made my experience unforgettable.  Cannot wait to visit again and hopefully see her at a higher level within the Suffolk Punch group."

If you want a cocktail like a bloody Mary you have to order at the bar INSIDE. If you want coffee then you have to go from the cocktail bar around to the coffee bar.  Pancakes were supposed to come eith whipped butter but didnt. Went inside to ask for whipped butter and got a little tub of regular butter.  Ridiculous. Wont be back.  Update:  I exchanged emails with management and I believe they took the review to heart and will be making changes.  Based on their gracious response and the high recommendation from my daughter, who enjoys dinner at Suffolk Punch, I am upgrading my review to 4 stars.  Next time I'm in Charlotte I'll be coming back to check up on you!  :)"
