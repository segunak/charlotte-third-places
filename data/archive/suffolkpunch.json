Of course we ordered the Chicken Biscuit and also got a side of the cheesy grits which were PHENOMENAL. Coffees were also great during the cold rainy day we were having. Also got some little treats that were displayed at the front register area. What I wasn't a fan of was the service. No one greeted us when we walked in (except the fellas in the back by the beer) and upon reviewing the menu, my partner and I felt rushed and as if we were an inconvenience.  No one came to see if we needed anything our entire meal and no one attempted to tell us to have at the least a \"day\" when we left. Overall....would I visit again? For the food - Yes!! but if I have the same rude vibes, it will more than likely be the last time."

Love the string lights. There was a band playing as party of Suffolk Punch's Daydream Music Fest.  We ordered through a QR code on our table. Service was so quick!!  Here's what I tried: - Grains and Things ($16): Large portion. Loved the ingredients. But the chicken was a little difficult to cut and there was too much goat cheese for my taste. Still good though! - Fungus Among Us ($16): OMG. So much flavor. So delicious. - Crispy Brussels ($6): Good! - Mac-N-Cheese ($6): Yummmm, currently craving this.  Suffolk Punch was awesome! Good for groups, date night, anything! Highly recommend!"

You get to order through an app and keep your tab open. Beers come out within a minute or too which is really impressive considering how busy it is. The food is a little pricy, but it's really good. We had the spinach artichoke dip which I really recommend, the thai chili flat bread, and the burger. Pay attention to the menu because the carmalized onion jam has strawberries. I also super appreciate the compostable cutlery. The beer was really good as well. The IPAs as well as the seltzers and the frozen slushie drinks. Not really a bad thing to say!"

Some lacked a welcoming personality. Trevor was the bright spot of the bunch. When weather permits, the outside patio with dedicated bar works great. Very nice coffee bar is a plus.

The environment of the back patio reminded me of a busy cafeteria- loud, hot mayhem. Service was not particularly memorable as you had to scan a QR code and order from your phone- someone would later drop off your order with minimal acknowledgement. I mention this because the brunch wasn't cheap and patrons are often times going to restaurants such as these in part for the experience. The food itself was decent, but nothing I'd return for. The drinks looked like something you might order at a beach bar- no care really taken in making them. Sadly, I don't know that'd return. At least not on a Sunday afternoon."

I was seated near the kitchen and had a perfect view of the area food is picked up from and delivered to tables. I observed a few of the women playing with/adjusting their hair and then grabbing plates to deliver it to tables. I observed one man that took his hat off adjusted it and put it back on right over the food holding area. These individuals did not wash or sanitize at all. The servers are responsible for adding fries that are held in a bowl to the plates. Because of their lack of cleanliness this was not well received. My food was just ok. My fries were overcooked and just warm. My burger appeared to have unknown particles, thinner than hair so I don't think that's what is was. My friend described her French toast muffin as very bad and something they should rework. It completely fell apart and was very soggy. Our server was nice but the hostess instructed us to wait at the to go ordering area. When someone came he told us to go to the hostess stand. She then said she thought we were ordering to go, not sure why she assumed that or at the least just asked. The best part was the cold brew cocktails, they were very good but would not make me return. Glad I went, now I know."

She was very attentive and constantly checked on us. I had a couple beers, and a shot of Bourbon along with a pretzel. I really loved the vibe they had here, the music playlist was amazing. Restrooms were clean and all staff wore masks while I was there.  I highly recommend stopping by, they're right on the blue line which makes it convenient if you have a few too many......  Sadly I didn't take the time to get photos, so you'll just have to go for yourself 😁"

Limited parking, so highly recommend the Blue Line light rail as there is a stop a couple hundred feet from this area that houses a couple different breweries. Was a bit disappointed in a couple of the seasonal drafts being out and it isn't even the middle of the month, yet. Still, there were some good selections of beer, cocktails and wine. The food is good and the queso served with blue chips has their own pineapple salsa on top that is very good. Definitely one place to visit again, but next time, take the Light Rail. Great outdoor seating area, too."

Parking is craaazy, arrive at 10am if you can. The venue is beautiful on the inside, and it smells amazing. We didn't wait long, 20 minutes. Our table was dirty when they sat us down , which is a bummer for me because I'm big on cleaning. The man was kind about it and quickly wiped it down ( with a dingy wash rag looking thing ). Our waitress was very short with us, un-atentive and seemed bothered by something. We had to ask several times for basic things such as napkins and forks , extra plates.  Chicken buiscut was dry,  the buiscut itself was delicious,  the gravy was delicious but the chicken was so dry. The potatoes were seasoned well, nice crisp 👌.  The French toast was soooo good 👍 😋!!!! The mimosa was very much just orange juice 👎 👎 👎. Menu was veeeeery limited for they were shortstaffed in the kitchen. As was explained to us.  I'll return in a few weeks give them another try,  as long as I font get that waitress"

Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. We enjoyed a number of drinks and they were all delicious. My eyes were bigger than my stomach. Each portion is a LOT so be aware of that when ordering for the table. I ate so many apps that I could barely eat my pizza. The chicken wings were fried perfectly and seasoned/sauced just right. You couldn't eat them without making a mess and we were completely fine making that mess. The cauliflower app was also very tasty. My pizza was topped with too many things so the middle was soggy and liquid-y. That would have been the only feedback from our evening there.

Good amount of beers available and they have decent wine. The food is nice too, the ham pinino  and the veggie burger were tasty.  You can be sat inside, quite cool, or sit outside on your own.  If you go outside you have to order at the counter on the side.  You wait for the drinks near by but the bring the food out for you.  Overall quite pleasant."

They used to host Robot Johnson comedy shows in an event space they unfortunately got rid of. Their lack of prep and staffing those nights gave me a good picture of the place. Was there tonight and although bars are allowed to stay open til 2 again, they chose to close at midnight. Alcohol can still be legally sold until 2 am. And legally sold alcohol in NC can be consumed until thirty minutes after close. They had muscleheads walking around kicking people out right at midnight who had full beverages. I informed them of the laws and they had some BS retort about private property as if liquor laws don't apply to every place that serves liquor. One guy claimed the restaurant angle and I've worked in a dozen restaurants in my time. It's not true. He was BSIng customers. I just... don't like this place. It's everything wrong with Charlotte."

I wish there was someone explaining how the restaurant works or at least better signage indicating how the service works. The staff could be more friendly too. Overall I'd return because of the food and ambiance. Also, we had ordered coffee with our food and never received our beverages. We had to go ask and then we were told we had to pick up with the barista. The communication between staff and customer was very poor and needs improvement."

She went to the bathroom with no issue and a bouncer comes over and threatens to kick us out. I explained it was not her being a drunken mess, but a stomach issue and that we would take care of it. He threatened us again and I explained to him again my wife was not feeling well and we would take care of it.

First, more vegan/vegetarian options please, it's 2019!! Second, it's super odd that there is no table service outside. Clearly a lot of time and money was spent constructing the garden farm tables and it's a big attraction of coming here. The waiters also seemed confused about how to handle people ordering food outside. Third, we came for breakfast today and they only had one food option, a ham and cheese sandwich. If you're going to pay staff to be open it makes sense to have a more comprehensive food menu. Again we love the concept, but hope these things can be improved to better the overall customer experience."

Nice restored building, combination of brick, iron and wood. Modern and rustic touches, lots of seating indoors and out. The staff was great, let us try some beers before ordering. I enjoyed there Ipa's and also their pilsner. We had some buffalo shrimp that were really good and hit the spot. We were there early on a Friday and it was not to crowded. There is a ton of apartments and condos in the area, I am sure it is packed evenings and weekends. Their beer is made on site, you can walk back and check on the large fermenters and brewing equipment. I believe they did offer tours. We took the tram so I can't comment about the parking. I really didn't see much but I have a feeling most people take public transportation or scooters. Those scooters are everywhere. It is family and pet friendly but not a lot for the kids to do. Their was a few corn hole boards and some room to roam around outside. Look forward to visiting again during our next stay in Charlotte."

The bar outside has limited beers, so we came back inside with hopes to find a spot at the bar. It was busy, which isn't their fault, but that did cause us to leave since we couldn't get a drink.

            "review_text": "Just to be clear, the food and drinks from Suffolk Punch are great, their customer service and event planning is one of the worst experiences I've ever had.  This place has been my new favorite go to spot for weekend brunch and craft beer, I've been coming here for months and the only complaint I've encountered is wait times on getting a table. Problem solved after finding the right times to go. While having brunch one day, my wife and I were party planning my daughters 2nd birthday when we came up with a brilliant idea, have the party at Suffolk Punch! Great food, drinks and plenty of space for guests. We inquired about it with our server and the hostess came by with their event planners information. The server and hostess showed us a great spot on the outside patio where we could have the party which sounded great until it became such a hassle trying to get ahold of their event planner. We sent multiple emails and called multiple times but she was never around. We were given the run around every time we followed up on an email to check our spam folder. FINALLY got ahold of their event planner a week before our planned party and was told she is no longer in that role and was not aware the staff was still giving out her name and information. When I asked for whoever the new event planner was, I was told they have not fulfilled that role yet. I was told a manager would reach out to me to help reserve a table, that call never came through. Luckily we had a plan B because no one from Suffolk Punch ever got back to us.  Revised review on 3/17/2019...  Spoke with the owner, he explained the event planner issue with me and understood my frustration and concern. He made things right and offered extraordinary hospitality during my next visit. I was very pleased and looking forward to my next visit to Suffolk Punch."

Love all the plants and beautiful booths/ tables etc. I ordered an Americano, which unfortunately was not the best-- seems simple to fix as it was sour so possibly the espresso machine just needs to be calibrated. Or it could be the type of coffee but I'm assuming they use Espresso blend. I would not order an espresso based beverage there again. My friend enjoyed the spiced latte and said that was very good. Our waiter was friendly and food came out in a reasonable time frame with a good presentation. I enjoyed the breakfast burrito-- salsa tasted very fresh and loved that it was the perfect size for a meal (no waste)! The tortilla itself could use a little work but everything else was very delicious. My friend had the veggie hash which was very beautiful and she said tasty. We went at 10:30 am and it was definitely more packed (including parking) by the time we left. So I recommend getting in early or be prepared to wait a bit."

The warm interior and wondeful menu made it a perfect place for a drink and an app. They have quite a selection of beers and wine, and a wonderful app of \"Frenched Wings\" that were so tasty, and perfect for (2) to share. The BBQ glaze and the Red Pickled Onion made it a culinary extravaganza. This is a lot to say about an app. The menu is all chef inspired and clean.

She gave honest recommendations on the food - she was not joking about the pimiento cheese - it was bomb!  Super knowledgeable about the beers on tap, and can recommend something based off of what you typically drink. Can be a bit slow when it comes to receiving food and drink, but it's worth it when your server is outstandingly nice. She definitely went over the top to make our experience wonderful.  She has promotion written all over her.  Absolute professional and made my experience unforgettable.  Cannot wait to visit again and hopefully see her at a higher level within the Suffolk Punch group."

If you want a cocktail like a bloody Mary you have to order at the bar INSIDE. If you want coffee then you have to go from the cocktail bar around to the coffee bar.  Pancakes were supposed to come eith whipped butter but didnt. Went inside to ask for whipped butter and got a little tub of regular butter.  Ridiculous. Wont be back.  Update:  I exchanged emails with management and I believe they took the review to heart and will be making changes.  Based on their gracious response and the high recommendation from my daughter, who enjoys dinner at Suffolk Punch, I am upgrading my review to 4 stars.  Next time I'm in Charlotte I'll be coming back to check up on you!  :)"

Our food came out faster than two coffees which meant my husband was waiting for the coffees while I ate my brunch and then he came back when I had finished (they don't bring it to your table if you are dining outside). That's a terrible customer experience that wasn't well thought out. If you want to eat separately from the rest of your party, come here..."

They ran out of the tea I selected but proactively brought me a delicious tea with an offer to replace it if it didn't like it. The barista's suggestion was spot on. Then I was there for a work event with a few dozen coworkers and the staff was incredibly prompt, attentive, and gracious as our team ate, drank, and closed the place down. I'll definitely be back to try lunch soon."

Immediately, we felt like an inconvenience because of the size of our group, and were told we could only sit at a table if we ordered food, which was no problem, but seemed silly when the cocktails cost as much as the food. The restaurant area was not busy at all. After asking for a sample of wine and not preferring it, I asked for another sample, and my server was clearly annoyed. She seemed like she had no interest in serving us. At $13/drink with 11 people, that's almost $150 round. We would have had at least 3-4 rounds this afternoon. Unfortunate for the restaurant. We are now at another bar/restaurant that is happy to have us. We will spend our money here."

The barista said to ask the hostess. The hostess said I could sit at bar which was not where I would normally sit for coffee and there were no seats available. By the way, the entire restaurant seating area was empty. She said we could go outside. We sat at tables on patio. The server said we could sit there 45 min until they started seating for dinner. 5 minutes later a server told me I needed to move and go to picnic area which was also packed. In short, get some tables for the coffee bar if  indeed, you are a coffee bar. I'm going by what your website says . It's a weird setup. The coffee was good but I wouldn't return for just coffee. And I've had lunch there too. Food was pretty good. Debatable whether I would return. I've never taken time to write a review but I left feeling unwelcome. If I were an owner I would want  honest feedback. Hope someone takes note."

We're talking $4 or less for a local beer, that's great in my opinion.  I ordered the chilaquiles- they were phenomenal. My friends ordered the French roast and the basic breakfast. No matter what the order - the food was cooked at a great temp, and it tasted fantastic. (Although I should point out that everyone agreed mine was the best, so order the chilaquiles if you can).  All in all - no complaints. The venue was clean - parking was easy to get. The neighborhood is walkable but a good way from downtown so would recommend driving. The bar is large so you could always get a seat there if there wasn't seating too!"

They also offer plenty of bar food such as pretzels with beer cheese. The space is absolutely massive and stunning. Pull up to a booth and hang out for a few hours. Daytime it looks like a workspace with plenty of people tapping away on their laptop. Nighttime is a lively restaurant. The outdoor portion looked like a blast, but was too cold when I went."

They have new warehouse space right next door that is super basic- no heat, a cooler with one keg, no music (??? so easy to do) but they do have some picnic tables and games (corn hole). I'm sure they'll be doing more to this space. We went to this warehouse space because we were a large party and wanted to sit and have drinks and maybe some snacks and there wasn't any spots big enough for us all. While there were open tables, because of the hour (about 4ish I think), they couldn't let us sit in them. It was super odd and while they were very nice about it and you could tell they struggled with the policy as well, they couldn't really fully explain why we couldn't sit there. I made a reservation on the spot and they sat us in about 30 minutes but we all thought it was so odd. Food was tasty but very expensive for the portion."

What I didn't like at all was the poor organization of the outside patio: you have to wake up and order at the bar outside because there are no servers who takes orders! what?? and you can order only beer or cocktails outside, but if you want coffee you need to go order it INSIDE by yourself and bring it out by yourself also!! seriously??? If the idea is to be a very classy brewery (the inside is super elegant), why sticking with poor service and careless organization in order to save on personnel?? Those numbers to put on the table after ordering food gives a gas station feeling and not a sophisticated look! Very cheap choice! You can definitely do better or think about another efficient way for managing the outside patio area! I ordered (pecan french toast and fried eggs sandwitch) and the chai tea: both very good! Since the food is on point, and the place itself also, please raise the bar with service!"

It's busy even on weeknights (relatively speaking), so it's a solid atmosphere with a wide variety of drink options.  However, they also position themselves as a coffee shop. When it comes to the coffee, it's not good. I've ordered several different coffee options, including my go-to Americano, and I have yet to enjoy any of the beverages. I want to like this place so badly because it's so convenient for me to go in the mornings, but I can't get over how awful the coffee is.  As a coffee shop it's a 1 star option. As a happy hour/casual drink spot it's a 5 star option.  I can't speak to the lunch menu because I haven't eaten here, but kind of hard to justify a $19 chicken salad...."

All of the plants are my favorite part. It was nice out so we sat on the patio.  They have a really large drink selection from their own beers, to other craft beer, to ciders, to cocktails. I had a cocktail and some ciders and they were all really good.  I ordered some small plates: the Pimiento cheese, the beet stained deviled eggs, and the tuna crudo. I enjoyed all of them, but they were a little expensive for the portion sizes you got.  My experience was pretty good until it started to get dark and cold outside and we tried to go inside. They wouldn't let us sit inside unless we ordered an entree. Given that we had already eaten and were trying to enjoy the brewery, this was very frustrating. I get that it's also a restaurant, but the fact that there is no way to enjoy the brewery without being outside is ridiculous.  We convinced someone to order an entree and the service inside want very good. The burger want cooked as ordered and the service was slow. The food is also pretty expensive.  I've avoided going here for happy hours since then because I don't want to be forced to sit outside if I don't want to eat. I think this is a pretty big problem they need to solve if they don't want to be a restaurant exclusively."

It comes out with 3 pieces of toast, three slices of everything and a little tiny dollop of the only cheese provided: blue cheese.  When I questioned if any other cheese is served (since, in the past, it was) I was told \"It's a meat board, not a cheese board.\"   Thanks for that rude explanation... It's also $14 and had $5 worth of stuff on it.

The brewista did a nice job at designing the coffees and they were flavorful. However, they were just not warm enough. We had the opportunity to also try some beers. The beers were very smooth, light and tasteful. The four stars are for the beers. However, working in this industry before, I find it tacky and distasteful when the owners-managers stand around and talk about their employees in front of customers. I also find it disappointing when they don't care to engage more with the customers than they do with each other. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and very well designed. But I would focus more on customer service, especially when the brewmaster is out and about and that's a great opportunity to engage with the customers who are trying his craft. Without customers you don't have a business. I would suggest focusing more on customers than each other. I would also suggest giving descriptions on your beer menu. Therefore, not asking customers to rely on the service of your employees when they are not readily available."

However... the server was not friendly nor very attentive (but the hostess was very nice); I ordered a cappuccino from their coffee bar and it was ok but was delivered without the essential saucer, spoon, and sugar packets (all I had was a knife and fork from my rolled napkin).  I know, it's such a minor complaint but it's a coffee bar whom I would expect to do coffee serving correctly; and lastly, the beer from the Hyde Brewing was flat.  :( Parking is tight in their side gravel lot on a Saturday.  Luckily we got there just in time and snagged the only available spot. Hoping these issues can get worked out because I think this place has great potential."

The no food thing between 3 and 5 is also strange. The food is good though and reasonably priced.  New place with lots of potential, but the staff need some better training.

He was very rude with his statement. We sat down back outside while our friends finished their drinks, only to be rudely ushered out at 950 by a staff member saying \"Guys we've got to go we're closing\" rather than politely asking us to finish our drinks and leave. Maybe this hipster restaurant should take a hint from the other successful bars and focus on customer service rather than over priced drinks.

The planters in the middle of the tables outside are such a cool idea and the hanging plants inside give the place a real rustic feel. Mike, our bartender was fantastic and answered any questions we had and was very quick to serve us. 10/10 would recommend!"
