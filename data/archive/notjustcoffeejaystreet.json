They can open the windows to make for an even more open sitting/lounging area. The open space keeps you from feeling bunched up against others and this is nice. There is a ton of seating both inside and out.  There aren't any \"nooks\" or corners where you can have a bit of privacy. This may not matter to some but I like it in a coffee shop; it's a bonus of sorts. There is also a bar that allows dogs across the street so you can sit outside and watch dogs at times and I love this."

It's called Not Just Coffee but after 2pm it is Just Coffee, and of course the other expected coffee shop fare like tea and muffins. So if you want anything that isn't \"just coffee\" and it's the afternoon then your hopes are dashed. But I didn't care too much and just ordered a latte. It was over 6 dollars after tax if I'm not mistaken. But the price wasn't that important to me as I assumed it would be a large (which I said in my order \"a large latte\") Well it was super tiny. The cup went in my hand and reminded me of that shot of Andre the giant holding a beer can. Except he was a giant and I'm 5 feet 8 inches tall. I asked \"is this a large?\" And he responded in a rather annoyed tone \"it is all one size\" which wasn't explained when i ordered a large size. Also for the price it is incredibly miniscule. On top of this I was \"dining inside\" and I was given a disposable cup. Why are they giving tiny paper cups rather than mugs. I looked around and every person had a paper cup inside. The latte was nothing special either. I hate Starbucks and I'd 100% rather go there than to this place ever again."

I ordered the mule which is a mix of ginger beer and espresso. Perfect to start my day. It has an open floor layout which means a lot of people can fit and enjoy the place with seating inside and out. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Clean restrooms however no highchairs or changing tables if you're being small ones with you. Street parking is available in front with additional parking in the rear. Handicap parking is located along the side of the building."
