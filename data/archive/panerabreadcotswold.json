I ended up having to go to PetSmart to get change for a $20 bill just so I could eat my dinner. Granted the cashier/server was amazing. News flash Panera, our society has not gone completely cashless, and until they do try to be somewhat accommodating with your customers who carry around cash still. There could be a very good reason why they have those strange green papers in their purses and pockets🤫"

We purchased a smoothie and shortly after we left she dropped most of it on the sidewalk. With her in tears, we walked back to grab another straw and salvage what was remaining. The team caught on to what happened and offered to quickly replace the smoothie. A gesture that was certainly not expected but very much appreciated and one that totally made my 3 yr olds day. We both left with a smile. Thank you again!"

The manager insisted it's invalid and bought from a 3rd party therefore it's invalid. I've never heard anything like this before and I believe she didn't want to do it manually like the instructions said or she didn't know how to do it. Later on I called the 800 # of Panera to check balance and after I typed in the card # it showed me the balance of $15.

I saw there are older reviews about customer service and my only guess is that this may have been during the height of the pandemic. Every restaurant has had a tough time with staffing and I have learned to be patient and especially to be kind to those that are now taking on multiple positions at one job. I have only had great experiences at the Sharon Amity location. The staff are super friendly and always get my custom order correct...okay, maybe one or twice it wasn't perfect but that is why I check my bag before I leave, even Chick-Fil-A gets my order wrong most of the time and I rarely go there. Another point I would like to make: The NC minimum wage is only $7.25 per hour. Granted I have no idea what Panera pays but still it is not $100K a year so please be kind to people in the service industry. They are working hard to serve YOU. Jumping down off my soap box.

I was greeted politely at the counter and Informed that the credit card machine was broke and it was cash only. After checking my pockets we placed our order. Me the signature chicken sandwich and my wife a Ceasars salad. After a short wait I was presented with a sandwich that appeared to be made in about 5 seconds. The sauce was so minimal I could hardly taste it, and the chicken? Cold to medium warm, looked like it was under the heat lights for the last 2 hours  and so dry it was almost inedible. Huge disappointment. I'll be back when everyone on the planet runs out of bagels."

Upon receiving confirmation for this order, I was advised that my order would be ready by 2pm and arrived around 1:55pm, their side of the order stated 2:30pm.  I spoke up after I overheard one of the cooks stating not to rush my order and spoke to my arrival time being 2pm upon confirmation. If Panera is going to have an “open” kitchen, it would likely be beneficial to provide them with some rudimentary Customer Service Training.

I should have walked out then, but, I gave it the benefit of the doubt. There was one staff working the register and another who seemed to be doing support stuff - cleaning buzzers. She had to be told to help with the busy, almost out the door line, by grabbing the pastry items for orders. No manager ever surfaced to the register area, even when the line was quite long. I ordered 6 bagels, split and a tub of cream cheese to go; a pepperoni pizza and a turkey bravo w/ a fruit cup; kitchen sink cookie and a brownie. The floor was sticky (thinking the stench was the fact that the floor was probably mopped the night before with dirty water that had sat all day), and it took about a 1/2 hour to get our food - dine in. I'd understand if it were lunch time, but it was after 1pm. Did I mention the floor was sticky? The whole floor. I walked from the front register to a table in the back by a window. Even the carpet was sticky. The restrooms needed a good cleaning as well. I had to go back to the front counter to get my bagels and cream cheese and noticed then that there were gnats in the bakery area. The line was still quite long and it was filling up in the dining area because people were waiting for their orders. All the one worker did was get bakery items, so, not sure how it took her 15 minutes to split 6 bagels, but it did. SMH The food counter: there was a worker standing outside the counter to hand people their orders. Umm, he would have been used much more efficiently in prepping the orders. It was a major manager fail to have him standing there doing nothing in between orders. The food: I ordered a pepperoni pizza w/ onions. I know that they have raw onions. Did they put raw onions on my pizza? Nope. Made too much sense. Pickled red onions were placed on my pizza. Disgusting to say the least. I didn't want to go through returning because it was already a hot mess. I watched a couple of people go get their money back and leave. I should have followed suit. This location needs a lot of help, starting w/ a 24 hour shut down to totally clean and sanitize. Followed very closely by a new manager and staff who will understand what teamwork means."

I could even smell the trash can through my mask (which is really saying something). Makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like.  The food was the normal “Panera Food,” nothing to write home about, but the Mocha Drink we ordered had some kind of grease in it that my mother couldn't even finish it (See picture attached).

Good coffee and bread offerings, but over time, was more and more dissatisfied with the food quality, and impersonal service, so I mostly stopped visiting.  Tried them again today for the first time in years.  Same Panera, same dissatisfaction.  Purchase overpriced food, wait until it's cold before it reaches your table (or walk up and get it myself while it's still hot), eat in cramped surroundings, take your dishes up to a dish station yourself.   You even get to clean your own table before eating.  (What service did I pay for that would warrant adding a tip to the purchase checkout screen?)   Ordered a 4 cheese croissant, which was served barely warm.  When I asked the staff member if they could heat it (in an oven or toaster) she pointed to the microwave and said I could do it myself.  Nothing like the taste of microwaved pastry... soggy and unevenly heated.  I also ordered a cafe mocha, and after the first taste, remembered why I go to Starbucks so often.  The coffee was warm not hot, drenched in a chocolate syrup that gave an almost medicinally sweet taste.  The whipped cream had mostly dissolved because it sat on the serving counter too long."

The food took forever to arrive and when it did, my order was wrong even though the report that came with the food clearly had my order correct. They corrected my order immediately, though I did not get a \"treat\" for my troubles as the order receipt clearly states. My sandwich, The Italian, was very different than I remember. Must be that \"clean food\" thing.  My fault for not checking the ingredients more closely.  It's just not the old Panera that I used to like so much."

I then asked to speak to a manager and he said he would have to transfer me to the location. It honestly makes no sense that i cant place an order with the location i am picking up from.

Today they forgot the egg on an egg sandwich!  They also had 3 of four coffee types empty.  I had to tell them they were empty! The only other alternative in this center is Bruggers.....and their service is equally bad.  Ugh!"

The service I received was warming and patient. When I was finished picking my order and went to place my order, I was greeted with only two payment options. Gift Card or Credit/Debit Card. I'm sorry, but not everybody uses banks and owns a bank account, so my business is going elsewhere because I couldn't pay the delivery person cash, let alone place the order for delivery.  When I called and requested to speak with the manager, I instead received a person, other than the manager, at the end of the line that was uneducated about the company and it's policies. She gave me an answer of \"There's no option to, uh, really pAyyy with cash because, um, that's just our pOOlicyy. That's what it was started with, that's what they are ending with.\" With a twang that was unnerving.  I'm sorry, but I'm not, you just lost my business."
