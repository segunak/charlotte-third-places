But, ordering curbside pickup here is a nightmare and I've seen customers complain about their orders not being ready. They either 1) Bring it out 10 minutes later or 2) Leave it sitting inside for you to pick up (even though I definitely picked the curbside option). I go here often because it's convenient, but I always give myself extra time because you usually have to wait for quite a while. Recently,  I also ordered curbside and the parking lot was extremely full, so I had to park down the row towards the end. I saw the person come out with my order but they just looked at the cars right in front of the store (didn't see mine or even look down the row) and went back inside. I ended up just leaving because I was late to work."

If there is one, it is always dealt with swiftly.  The food is up to standards for a Panera Bread, and the location is very convenient for me.  Prices are a bit high, but no higher than other Panera locations.  All items, as well as the self serve soda fountain, are set out for customers, which takes away the burden of having to track down an employee to help with something minor.  Yet, staff is always responsive when needed.  Wait times are a bit long during lunch hour, but they do correspond to the amount of customers present, so this is understandable.  There is a nice screen near the to-go wait area that displays the order in which you may expect to be served, as well as how many people are ahead of you."

From a establishment as nice as Panera, I recommend that they step up the level of customer service.   A simple question, such as 'is there anything else we can get you?', or 'thank you for coming to Panera Bread, hope you enjoy your meal.' It's so easy to evaluate the level of experience at any establishment,  yet very few do so."

This morning they brought me a sprouted grain roll (which comes free with a soup or sandwich order) because they were out of whole grain bagels - hardly an adequate substitute. It had not been toasted as ordered. The server should have let me know the bagel I ordered was out, and asked for my preference before bringing a roll. To be fair, he asked if that was alright - but it would have been better to check first.  The restaurant is clean, but the food and service are not nearly as good as I've experienced at other Paneras."

Ordered lunch past week and seated myself out side to wait for my meal.  About 10 minutes ites goes by another gentleman who also chose to sit outside sits at a neighboring table.  Fast forward a few minutes his food arrives.. I begin to think ok that's strange... look at my receipt to realize it's been 21 minutes since I place my order (had been reading emails but didn't realize it was that long, just that it was a long time ..)  I decide to go see if maybe they just left it on the pick up area and didn't know I was outside but apparently my order was never even made.  Manager calls the order \"on the fly\" assures me \"I'll take care of this\" at the time I wasn't sure what that meant but once he brought my meal at (29 minutes after order at this point) he says \"I'll take care of this meal for you, I'll refund it.  Sorry about the incident.\"  I thought no worries mistakes happen, it was handled well.  The issue is, while I'm ok not receiving a refund, the $14 is immaterial, the issue I was then lied to, and never received a refund.  I would have been ok with the apology and no refund, but stating \"I'll refund this meal\" then not doing so leaves me with a poor view of this location.  I did make sure I allowed for time for a refund as it can take a few days, today is one week akd no refund was credited.  I'll not return even though my it's directly across the street from my office and the most convenient place."
