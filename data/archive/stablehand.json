We live in Southpark and don't mind taking a drive even on a work day to start the day right with this dish. My partner gets the sausage breakfast sandwich which he loves. Great flavors and nice vibes! Coffee is also well made. Need to stop by in the evening to try some of their natural wines. Great efforts and team!"

They currently have a Seasonal menu which offered an super tasty Rosemary Latte along with other unique creations.  The Vanilla Latte was perfectly sweetened and just the right temperature. We will be back!"

Honorable considering there is no shortage of coffee shops here in Charlotte. I had the pecan pie latte with almond milk instead of the standard whole milk and a side of the sourdough that comes salted and with butter. Absolutely amazing! I scarfed the majority of it down in the car lol! There is on site parking here for those who have parking anxiety like me! There is also free street parking nearby as well. If you're following gps, turn in when you see Penn Station. Stable Hand is in this plaza. They also have wine and beers (both canned and draft!) I didn't get the chance to try it out today but I will definitely be back another day! Thank you Stable Hand and thank you Offline for having this place as a one of the monthly rewards for November. Excellent choice!"

There were a lot of people working when I went during weekdays. No too cozy, lore kind of the clean and minimalistic type. The matcha was well prepared. Nice taste and texture. Not lumpy at all. I enjoyed it. The service is good too. The food was ok. Very cute presentation. I has the Avo Tart. It was too pricey, in my opinion. The avocado wasn't very flavorful. There was a bit too much of this hot oil on it. I added and egg. They call it soft egg and say the egg white is cooked, but it isn't. It was an almost completely raw egg, which some people may like, but I like the egg white better done. They did change it and offered a scrambled egg instead, which was cooked in a funny way. Although it was a scrambled egg. This was $10.85. I still enjoyed the drink very much. Thank you."

The morning after the wedding @sugga_mystery and I woke up early before our friends were awake and decided to hang out and stumbled upon @stablehandclt a little coffee shop close to downtown.  I'm almost embarrassed to say I'm not really much of a coffee person but this place has a pretty nice breakfast menu - particularly their strawberry basil stuffed biscuit.  Let's breakdown why: 1. The biscuit: this biscuit is buttery, soft and flakey all at the same time... that's the most you can ask from a biscuit 2. Frosting: this frosting was very sweet but somehow light, not overly thick, it pairs perfectly with the buttery biscuit 3. Strawberry and basil: you never really think of basil in a sweet biscuit but the two together taste fantastic... I wish I could have had two..."

The cashier was a bit rude, not what I expect at a craft coffee shop 2. The hot oat latte we had may as well have been iced, it was the most Luke warm coffee I've ever had  Overall, it's great espresso, but that comes more down to the roaster than to anything else. Maybe they were having a bad day so I'll come again, but for now, 3 stars it is."

They even having evening food, alcohol and a gorgeous collection of bottles of wine, many of which are natural wines. Don't let the small size of the shop and menu scare you- everything is delicious. The savory rice porridge bowl may be my new favorite breakfast item in the city."
