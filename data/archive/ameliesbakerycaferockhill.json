            "review_text": "Updating from 2* to 1*. It's been 5 months and no one cared do respond. I love the original Amelie's in NoDA, Charlotte, the downtown one and the Pineville location but this Rock Hill one was a disappointment. The art and location are amazing, the building is the best out of all of them. Beautiful light, bright warm eclectic place, does not disappoint. But, the service was halfway decent. I was really surprised. The young kids were super nice but many of them were just standing around socializing. They got my tea order wrong, couldn't tell me what was inside the herbal tea, they just names the color. I asked if they have lavender, they didn't tell me it was about 75% chamomile and only part lavender. Loved the tea! But, I had to get up and tell them that they only gave me Earl grey leaves and there were no herbs in it, they forgot to put the second bag of tea in the cup after they charged me extra for it, which they have never done before. -1 ⭐ They walked straight past me, as if I was not standing by the pastries waiting to be served on the 2nd time. I don't know if they just ignored me on purpose because I was taking photos of the pastries or because they were having a staff meeting with 5 young people just sitting in a circle and not paying attention. Those bring our fresh pastries didn't say anything to the group, they just all were talking about what came out of the oven. I don't know happened, it took me actually coming up to the register and trying to get someone's attention to order a second pastry to go. - 1 ⭐ Our bigger table on the first floor was super sticky, must be because they use cleaning products on a table that should not be treated with chemicals or because they use dirty rags. That table should be taken care of, I couldn't place my hands on it or my bag. They took a while to make the food/tea. There was a ton of people working and the place was not packed after the lunch rush hour, we were there getting food after 1:30 on a Tuesday. Also, their music was too loud, it was hard to have a group conversation. And, I guess the large space does not have anything to absorb sound on the floor or walls so it was naturally louder then it could have been maybe because of the windows and all the hard surfaces. -1⭐ I was disappointed that the tarts had their fruits pushed to the side as if the entire tray was tilting sideways when they were made. It tasted great as usual because they use the same recipes as all the older locations but there was no finesse to it. A crooked pastry is not something ideal to serve a photographer who's trying to get a grea shot and all the fruits are pushed to the side overflowing on the tart itself. I was underwhelmed, it felt like an authentic, eclectic, local European bakery and deli was taken over by an American franchise with horrible training for their really young employees who didn't know how to offer good customer service skills and lacked people skills or the skills to take an order and deliver it correctly and timely, especially when they charged extra for it. To the owner. I hope you read and make some improvements because all the other locations had me come regularly and enjoy the place for hours. This was my first visit. The only reason I'll go back is because no one else makes those European pastries around here correctly, or unless I have to meet someone there. I was hoping it would be my new favorite spot down here since Rock Hill doesn't have many eclectic places to offer. Unfortunately unless they improve, I won't be coming back regularly to spend time in there."

            "review_text": "Amelie's Bakery in the beginning was a wonderful place to work. I was able to expand my knowledge and truly follow my aspirations to become a pastry chef. I was learning and growing, as I hoped. Then something shifted with in the managerial staff, that was unsettling. The happy, professional environment I once loved was slowly deteriorating. The new Assistant General Manager Renee, was unprofessional, hostile and combative in the work place. She often would speak poorly about other workers including myself. In addition, she would encourage a hostile catty work environment. I recently had the flu and decided it would be best to take the time off of work. After going to the doctor, I felt it would be best not to expose my coworkers. I even spoke to Amanda who advised I would be covered and report to work Monday 11/28/22. I was following the handbook and proper protocol as instructed and stayed in communication throughout the week. As I returned to work Monday 11/28, I was able to clock in, then immediately directed by Renee to come have a private conversation. She then advises I had been terminated effective immediately. I was shocked at her demeanor as she was delivering this termination with sheer gratification. She even smirked as she delivered this news. I couldn't believe her lack of compassion or empathy as she was letting me go. I  tried to provide the doctors note to prove I wasn't in violation. But all she insisted was a point system which was never disclosed during any point of the duration of employment. I am at a loss of words, how a place which once provided me satisfaction and joy became such a dramatic, catty, unprofessional work environment. Poor management is the cause of my termination and it is truly disheartening that a company would keep such a deplorable person on their staff. I wouldn't suggest working here, as you will more than likely have the same situation occur right before the 90 day mark."

The vanilla cream inside was very creamy and had great flavor. Their tartlets are delicious and come in many varieties, including my favorite: lemon raspberry. Their crème brûlée is the best I've ever had, and the coffee is very good as well. I love the atmosphere here! Lots of beautiful paintings adorn the walls, and many decorations include repurposed materials. I HIGHLY recommend eating here if you are coming to Rock Hill. I will certainly be back soon!"

This picture doesn't do them justice but trust me when I tell you that even the stuff that doesn't look particularly fancy or special will still knock your socks off. I ate my mini tart before having a chance to get a picture. The sandwich has plenty of delicious topping, they don't skimp on the meats like some places, and their provident mayo (spelling?) adds a touch of beauty to even a regular ol' sandwich.  Come here and you will eat, drink, and be merry."

When we came out, since they told us we could not eat inside because they were about to close, but we realized we did not had any napkins. I went back and kindly knocked on the door since it was locked. My daughter which was beside me, was there watching how the 3 young ladies that were working the shift were ignoring me/us.  I stayed there and made signs for napkins, and  after a while a blonde young lady with a very bad attitude, according to her body language and the way she came to us. She brought us 5 napkins and she stated to me that if I needed more napkins I could  go around the corner to a Jimmy Johns.  I told her, that  I just came out of the Amelie's location, and spent money with them, that I am their customer and they could have been kind to me and provide good service. She tried to close the door in my face while I was talking, all this in front of my  little daughter. I said to her that this was not the way to treat clients. At the time there was a young lady with black hair working on the cashier machine, and another one just looking. I have never had an experience like this, I will  never come to this location again. Hopefully this lady wasn't being racist to us.  Staff should have a customer experience training. Experience is all in all types of industries."

I only had spinach in my soup as well. Not sure where the other veggies were, but I'm very disappointed for $7 a bowl. Lastly, my to-go bowl of soup was only filled up 3/4 of the way. Not like it matters since it was like drinking oil. When I've had this soup in the past from other locations, the broth is super creamy and flavorful, and it's loaded with veggies. This version of the soup was oily and beyond bland. Would not recommend this location."

I'm a French Cuisine freak, so I am highly critical of French Restaurants, Bakeries, Cafes and Bistros. You can't go wrong with Amelia's. The food is GENUINELY French and oh, so, so, good. The girls at The Rock Hill location could have been more friendly and hospitable, but perhaps they were just having one of those not so good mornings, we all have. BUT. It sure didn't come out in the food. Everything was made to perfection. If I had more time in the area, I would have been back for more. This is definitely a must go to French Bakery and Restaurant. The Croque Monsieur was great. As all of the other items I had. And you can't walk out without any kind of the bakery items or you will be missing even more good items. The pastries and the small mousse cups never made it to lunch hour. I will most definitely be back for more of Amelie's. The best way to sum it up, is I told them they needed to open one up in Chattanooga, TN, where I'm from. They really deserve more than 5 stars."

This of course is a business issue and not a customer issue however, today (after working in the coffee shop all day with no complaints) an older white woman complained to the workers that she almost tripped over my chord. Which led them to come over and ask me to unplug my set up and possibly move. My chord was not in a main walkway and there of course were many other routes to her seat however, I chose to be compliant and unplug.  My grievance with this is that this is a coffee shop and many others come here to work. Without proper outlets I cannot work. The lack of outlet and placement of outlets are NOT my problem. However, due to the complaint of one white woman I was expected to unplug and possibly relocate.  Make out of this what you will but It was not a great experience for me."

We were asked to leave after paying $45 (including a $7 tip) because we brought in  a happy meal (one of the few things our austistic daughter will eat). I was holding the box and drink while I ordered. It wasn't like we smuggled it in. We sat down to eat upstairs, when the manager-who took the order-delivered our sandwiches and THEN told us we would have to eat outside or leave due to thier policy. We tried to explain but she would have none of it. It was in the 40's and windy that day. We went and ate in the car. My daughter asked to go back and tell the manager how she felt. (I don't think she cares about people like me, she saod). She did so only to be told that the policy is because people would cone in, not buy anything, and leave a mess. Funny thing, they have a display about how they are sponsoring  an \"inclusive park\". I guess the resturant is a different story. How rude."

The salads are great with homemade dressings and fresh, quality ingredients. They often inspire me to recreate them at home. The sandwiches are good especially when you choose something that pairs well with the croissant. The soups I've tried haven't been anything that I'd come back again for but I'm hoping that changes eventually. However, my family has grown up with my homemade soups like oven roasted butternut squash soup with homemade chicken stock and a good splash of cream served with garlic buttered croutons, fresh parmesan, and toasted & lightly salted pecans on top. The fruit cups are delicious, fresh, and a great option to add to your main entree at lunch or dinner."

Even the 4 star rating I'm giving them here is a stretch for me. I'm only giving it to them because I know they try. It's just that in my opinion, the people running this place can't seem to bring the package together. The pastries are wonderful. But I'd probably be less disappointed in the experience of getting them, if I could get them from a drivethru window. There's something about the ambience or atmosphere of this place that kills the pleasure of the pastry for me. But I keep going back. Hoping. And enjoying the taste of their wonderful creations."

This place is expanding and really does have the potential to go global like Starbucks if they get lucky.  They are also priced very well.  If you do not specifically like French pastries you may not like this place.  They are not overly sweet like processed foods in other areas.  You may get something thinking it has light fluffy dough and find out that it is flaky in texture.  It will be a culinary adventure for you!  Finally, are you gluten free? Good!  They have stuff for you here.  You will see a hip person in the back assemble your sandwich with TLC.  They also have gluten free pastries including macaroons and their signature salted caramel brownie.  This is a MUST VISIT landmark in the area.  Definitely a destination restaurant.  Check them out or you will feel \"le not good.\""
