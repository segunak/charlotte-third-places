I know you shouldn't even have to write quiet when explaining a library, but it's been my experience that not all libraries in Charlotte are quiet. They have story time available for toddlers and babies. Not as many toys for kids but they do have tons of computers which stay available most of the morning. They have a lot of Spanish children's books and tons of picture books. I was really happy to see that they have a room for nursing mothers, and a family bathroom.  My kids really loved it here. As far as the selection and adults I only went through non fictions which word decent lots of new books and well kept. Lots of computers in the internet lab. It seems like they have a really large community room although it was being a news for early voting. Due to the fact they had early voting going on parking was really hard to find. Other than that my run-ins with the staff were nice they were well knowledge and very helpful. They have a patio available although it was not open and I'm not sure if it's always closed or just happened to be closed today. I'm happy to have found it can't wait to go back!"

The book supply is nice (excluding a variety of manga, like most places in the U.S.) but overall it's a great place. They've been initiating programs (for kids, teens, and adults!) and brought in new technology; which took away from the original comfort, but is helpful to those who need it! I recommend this library for people who want to be comfortable when they work! There are these 'quiet rooms' that kind of block out sound! It's a small library, I think (having only one other one to compare it to.. kind of!). It's nice."
