The burrito with ghost pepper cheese is one of my favorite breakfasts in Charlotte. It's THAT freaking good. We usually go in the morning so we can have breakfast, but one of these days I need to try their lunches.  The bartender was extremely knowledgeable and made some excellent suggestions. I went home happy! We've also taken the dogs a few times and sat on the patio, which is fun, and I don't know if they still have it on the weekends because I work, but they used to do a small farmer's market out front.

We gravitated to the bar and had a glass of their excellent house draft. The coolers are filled with beers and wines that you can purchase and drink out on the patio. What a wonderful idea, mega selection and save some money by buying a six pack and splitting it with your friends. Great coffee and breakfast options are on offer. This makes for a great hub for the neighborhood, I am very all in on this place."

We were given a couple of free sandwiches so today I drove 6 miles to get our order. This week was 3 times worse than the week prior. The produce is old, tomatoes are mush and the bread was hard and stale. Those were the good parts of the sandwich. The avocado was 3 days past ripe and tasted old and was applied in globs in the constancy of guacamole. The inside and out of the sandwich were covered in it and it was leaking through the paper. I never had a problem when we went to the store in South End. Sadly it closed, i am really hoping that the new one will present the good quality that they state they have."

We ordered today and my co worker had the Californian and it was disgusting the avocado was like the thick glob that she had to remove, the tomatoes were over ripe and her bread was stale. I had the Simple Simon no onion, add honey mustard......Nope received water turkey, over rippened tomatoe and stale bread with absolutely no honey mustard, sandwich was dry!! When I called in the order they knew it was a credit from last week....WHY would they not go out of their way to make sure the order was correct and edible??

This place definitely fit the bill!  To begin, this place is a literal market. More of a bodega really. You walk in to a small snack shop. They have local cheeses and meats and jar items. And chips, and t-shirts, and cigarettes. If you turn right there is a deli in the next room. There's a cooler with premade sandwiches, salads, pastas, cheeses, etc. And they have vegetarian and vegan items aplenty in there. There is also a random vending machine for musicians with drum sticks and stringed instrument strings.  If you continue straight when you walk in past the bathrooms on the left and the register on the right, you'll come to a small 6 stool bar on your left with 15-20 beer taps and a lot of wine options. They also had canned and bottled beer. In fact you can peruse the extensive beer section at the back of the store and drink it thee if you'd like! There's also a few tables and chairs to sit at, but not a whole lot. You can also drink out on their front patio, that has heaters when it's cold.  This was just a very interesting place to spend an hour at on a Saturday night. But it was fun and the beer was delicious and the company friendly. I'd stop back in Everytime I'm in the area!"

This employee in question is responsible for the supervision of the front patio. Every time I visit this establishment, he initiates an altercation with me for some reason. One night I was defending a dog getting kicked by a belligerent drunk who kept irritating other customers, and he yelled at me telling me he would kick me out if I kept talking to this guy. Recently a female friend dropped a glass by accident and he came over (once he finished on his phone) to yell at her and tell her she was drunk (which she was not) and if she kept it up, that she would be kicked out. Meanwhile, minutes after I complained to the manager... who did absolutely nothing to fix the situation or even acknowledge it.. a male at a nearby table broke his glass and provoked a very different response from this employee. Rather than react aggressively he instead treated the incident with a complete lack of concern. Then afterward was seen laughing and side hugging him. This has thoroughly turned me sour against this establishment, and the group I have been with. After two attempts to impress my concerns to the manager on duty, with no response, I have given up on any good thoughts on this place.. and will not return."
