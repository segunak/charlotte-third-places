I've heard many great things about this place, and to my surprise, The Hobbyist exceeded my expectations. My friends and I all got the Chai and it was very delicious, probably the best Chai I've ever had. And my friends agreed, it was also the best Chai they've had and we are obsessed! It had a fresh spiced flavor and was pretty sweet - as though they melted a gingerbread cookie into a beverage. Not only that, the vibes are cozy, classy, and very chic. The barista who served our drinks also had a lovely personality: they were friendly and very funny! Now whenever someone asks where I can find the best Chai, I will immediately say The Hobbyist!!!"

            "review_text": "I've been going to The Hobbyist for a couple years now. It's always been one of my favorite coffee shops + bottle shops in Charlotte, and in general! It always has an amazing beer and wine selection. The coffee is delicious. I would typically put five stars for it, but the recent \"Hobbyist unplugged\" has really dropped the quality of the shop for me.  I never write bad reviews, because I am a service worker (barista + server) and know the heartache they can cause for a lot of people! I am genuinely writing this review because I love this shop and am sad to love it less. I also want to point out this review is not about the baristas, the drink quality or shop quality, but I feel like this is important for anyone considering going to get work done on weekends.  I went into the shop tonight, excited to get some work done over a couple beers! I walked in, saw the signs on the bar, saying no laptops! I completely understood. (They used to have a rule about laptops on the bar during busy times! I respected it!) But then I looked around and saw the signs on every table. I had already ordered my beer and I asked the employee if I'd not be able to do work, and he said no, there are no laptops allowed right now. I even asked about outside tables and was told it wasn't allowed.  I understand the balance between bar and coffee shop! However, I was one of four customers in the shop at that time. I was there to spend some money, work on my laptop, and leave by the closing time. If it was busy and I was taking up valuable space of people who may drink more, I would understand. However, it was empty, so I just didn't understand the point. I quickly drank the beer he already poured, and went home.  A review before mine, mentioned how they didn't advertise this enough, but then someone responded saying there are signs on the door. However, unless you follow the shop on social media, this is not clear anywhere else. And if you're someone googling a place to get some work done, The Hobbyist still comes up on weekends. Getting your things together, and going out of your way to try to go to one of the only places open past 8 that is (was) good place to work, and then finding out you can't, kinda sucks (especially when it's empty).  As someone who has gone to the Hobbyist countless times, ordering beer, wine, or sometimes coffee/tea, I am just sad to see the time I spend there cut significantly because of this new policy."

I didn't know where to check out, and she got angry about it and rushed me when I inserted my card. She didn't ask me if I needed assistance nor did she give me the to-go cup I requested when I purchased a chai tea. Anyways, things got progressively better when the young African American woman entered. She was more polite and asked if I needed anything, and was pleasant to be around as I sat and worked on my laptop. Soon the first girl left and it was even better when the three gentlemen entered. Had the best tasting Caramel Macchiato, and the customer service was much better from them. The experience got better and plus the shop doubles as a brewery too! So that was pretty cool! It's a good place to go within the area when out on a date or visiting the NoDa area."

Drinks aren't overly sweet a.la Starbucks. (the entire purpose of going to a small coffee shop imo). - Even when To-Go, barista still took the time to put an appropriate design in my latte.

This is also not a review of the staff, the beverages, or the ambiance, but I felt like this was an important message. I went to prepare for the work week on Sunday afternoon and found the tables riddled with small \"No Laptop\" signs on the tables. At the time, my initial thinking was that the establishment did not want computers on the furniture (because the alternative, banning them completely, seemed absured given that I regularly worked at The Hobbyist this summer. Shortly after getting my tea did one of the employees let me know about their new \"unplug policy\" on the weekends to give patrons a chance to connect with one another in person (although, when I looked around, the policy didn't seem to be efficacious). On the weekends, I sometimes need to get out of the house and complete work in a neutral space with other people who are similar in that regard, but I feel that this recent policy overplays its hand and falls short of the intended goals. Restricting patron's autonomy and choice in the entire space detracts from the neutrality of what I feel a coffee shop represents."

The chai latte is exactly what a chai latte should be. It didn't taste overly sweet like many do and the different spices and herbs of the chai were present and clear. Their espresso was also wonderful. I'm not usually someone who enjoys just straight espresso but I suppose I do when it is done right. The Hobbyist does it right.

Its hard to use this coffee shop like a coffee shop when you cant talk to the person next to you or study. Additionally, they have a big garage door in the front, which they keep open way too much, when its very hot and very cold. The owners don't give the workers the authority to close it, even when the weather is terrible.  Reply: Thank you for your reply... wasn't looking for PR response though... Just letting the general public know what the shop is like. The back area consists of a couch and 3 chairs, when there's a band or the doors are open, those get filled VERY quickly. I've asked about the windows, and been told that the owner watches the employees over the video camera's, and makes them keep the doors open even when they and/or customers want them closed."

They have pastries delivered from a local bakery down the street too (which I think is amazing since they don't have a kitchen in house)  The atmosphere is stunning. You can tell that whoever designed the space carefully curated the antiques and plants with intention! They have plenty of seating but from what I could see it was filling up fast.  This is now my new favorite specialty coffee spot in Charlotte! Way to go Hobbyist!!!!!"

My girlfriend and I went Sunday afternoon to get some work done before the week. She only wanted a water to start out, and we were told by a worker, Jonathan, that if we didn't order anything more than water we would be asked to leave. It was odd considering that he walked straight up to us individually and said that. We go pretty frequently, always order food and drinks, drop a good amount of money there on a weekly basis, and occasionally buy bottles of wine. It was definitely a very disrespectful event to come across, and I have never really come across something like that before.

This go around I ordered an IPA and the fill was PERFECT.  Up to the rim.  My beertender slowly walked my order to the bar, making sure not to spill a drop.  Well done, Beertender.  While enjoying my tasty beverage, I perused the beer fridges.  I found a rare bottle you don't normally find in this area and set it on the bar to take home.  Staff was attentive and friendly.

Quality of coffee/ tea drinks is outstanding. The staff & owners are above & beyond lovely. The sense of community is always flowing in its air. The staff is super caring & friendly. Selection of their beers & wines is super professional. Friday & Saturday nights live music always bring extra extra cool vibe into it too."

            "review_text": "Order: Fall Latte, Rice Krispie, Chocolate Truffle Price: $13 Positives: Super cool space (especially if you like drinking), they have a small sampling of lots of different stuff (wine, beer, coffee, food), their chocolate truffle was killer Negatives: The coffee itself was pretty weak, seems like it might be a better place to drink than get coffee tldr: Purely from a coffee perspective, the Hobbyist is ok. It's definitely not bad, but I feel like they might suffer from trying to do so much that they don't really specialize at any of them. If your looking for a place to drink though this whole review doesn't really apply since we only went there for the coffee.  Thoughts: my wife and I were driving up to Virginia to see some friends and spend the night in Charlotte. We did some pre-scouting for coffee shops and decided the Hobbyist would be one of the places we stopped in. I wasn't quite expecting how diverse the Hobbyist is when I first came in the door. They sell food, they have a very large beer and wine selection, they have beers on tap, and then almost in a separate area they have a full coffee bar. Now, in my experience when a place tries to do too much at once it can often end up doing all of it well but maybe not the best. Regardless, we decided to try one of their seasonal fall lattes and one of their chocolate truffles. The barista also convinced us to try a rice crispy treat because she said it would be the best rice crispy treat we've ever eaten.  It took a couple minutes to grab our coffee and we poked around the shop to find that they have a wide variety of things for sale. They serve food, sell candles, dog treats salads, sandwiches, all sorts of stuff. And it did seem like a pretty cool place to hang out or maybe get a little bit of reading done in their back study nook area. We were looking to pick up our stuff to go as we also need to go grab dinner that night, so the reading nook remained unused.  Once the coffee arrived we grabbed the rice crispy treat and headed out the door. The barista was right with the rice crispy treat, to her credit. It was the best rice crispy treat I've ever had; but...it was still just a rice crispy treat. It was still just sugar, in this case brown sugar, marshmallows and rice crispy's. If you're not a huge fan of rice crispy treats this thing isn't going to blow your mind. If you are you'll probably love it!  Unfortunately the latte was honestly super week. I could taste that there was coffee in it but it definitely didn't give me that little bit of bite that a good espresso does. The flavor was there I just think I would have doubled or tripled the amount of espresso in it, or maybe just served it with a lot less milk. Either way it wasn't something I really enjoyed. The truffle on the other hand was fantastic. Very creamy super dark chocolate he fantastic little treat, if only I had some really strong coffee to drink it with.  I think that this place honestly just has a lot going on. I really don't want to say that they have too much going on, but it feels like that a little bit. As I mentioned earlier, I have no idea if this is a great place to hang out and drink beer because my review is solely focused on the coffee portion. That being said, I probably wouldn't be here just to drink coffee very often."

Came here for the first time for coffee and desert after a disappointing experience at a nearby deli (I won't name names) and the atmosphere, vibe, and friendly service completely lifted my mood! I could see myself spending significant time hanging out and working here; a rustic/industrial vibe with tons of cool tables, booths, and nooks. Plenty of outlets to plug in your electronics. The coffee is excellent and smooth. They make all of their syrups in house. And we tried a Torsades which was a twisted chocolate croissant with sea salt. Delicious on all accounts! So many more things I'd like to try here. Patricia was super helpful in giving us the run down for our first time here. I really dig this place and I think you will too! - Adam from Appetite + Adventure @appetiteandadventure"

The staff has always been friendly and helpful, and the coffee is amazing. Please note that this isn't Starbucks, so when you order a coffee, latte, cappuccino, etc. it may take time. I know the one lady can do latte art and it was neat watching her.  The clientele is super yuppie/uppity and often lacks diversity, but that is no fault of the stores, just the location. Do your thing if you are alone and you'll be fine. The setup is awesome if you get to work from home or often have projects you would like to tackle on your laptop as there is plenty of seating and plugs virtually everywhere.  Their beer selection is pretty solid when you consider the multitude of coolers/book shelves with various crafts local and abroad."

There are 4 fridges in a L shape. Bryson, the owner, was helping a guy who was literally reading the title of every beer and asking if it was good. We tried to grab a beer out of the cooler and got elbowed out. We waited over 2 minutes and kept being ignored. Tried again to say “excuse me” politely and try to grab the beer we wanted from the case, but we were physically boxed out. When we are were finally able to access the cooler, we had to wait to be checked out because Bryson continued to chat with the customer and ignored us, who were trying to check out. We lived in the neighborhood and we're excited to support a new local business - won't spend our money after that experience."
