From croissants and baguettes to cakes and pastries, everything is made on-site and with high-quality ingredients.  The service is always friendly and efficient, and the atmosphere is cozy and inviting. I especially love the selection of unique and exotic pastries that you don't often find at other bakeries.  I highly recommend trying the Mont Blanc or the strawberry cloud cake, they are both absolutely heavenly! The prices are also very reasonable, making it a great spot for a quick and satisfying breakfast or lunch. Overall, Tous les jours is a must-visit for anyone who loves good food and great service."

I am a coffee lover, I mean real coffee not what you get served at specialty places, that's just sugar if you ask me.  But this place has what I like, an Americano with a delicious flavor that doesn't overpower the pallet and complements the pastries.  The croissants are great, my favorites are the ones with the almonds on the outside, my wife likes the ones filled with chocolate. The cheese cake is a great choice as well, it is a treat worth driving.  It is not too sweet and is nice and creamy like.  The crockets were great too but I think they will be better if they were warm, but this is just my preference.  Great place to go for a coffee and you can sit down inside, by the counter and they also have a second floor or do like we did, drink and taste some of the treats then go for a walk around the neighborhood it was really nice."

I was able to try once before moving back to Charlotte. I did not have a long wait as others mentioned and actually had a very helpful gentleman ask if I needed help when  standing at the case browsing.  It can be overwhelming only because they are so many things you can purchase and they all look yummy. Today we had the honeydew melon soft, strawberry croissant, strawberry cloud cake, fruit pastry, kimichi croquette, mango smoothie and the honey lavender latte. Some of this was for home and others so I can't speak on everything. The kimchi croquette's flavor and texture is so good, my daughter liked her honeydew loaf and smoothie and I loved the latte. I also had a taste of the crème cake and it was moist and fluffy. I can't say I will return every week since they are in Charlotte and I am watching what I eat but on a weekend day, I definitely will more than likely be here every other week."

So the response of the staff there is very much expected. Regardless when I went, it was super busy, but the staff handled my questions and wants with amazing customer service.  I would honestly recommend coming to this bakery, but like in any business that is food related... please be patient. I see people stressing out the staff when really, all there is too it, is to be patient, be attentive to drink order calls, and follow their directions.  Overall, some pastries to try, I'd say, would be the strawberry croissant and their kimchi croquette. Their cloud cakes are amazing also.

            "review_text": "RUDEST BAKERY in Charlotte!!!! Two friends and I visited today after our dinner at a restaurant close by. We came in at 7:40. We chose our pastries(we only chose 6 pastries and some macarons as the options were slim since it was late) and we ordered two of the seasonal strawberry drinks and go to pay (total was about $60). The cashier asks us if we would like our food for togo or for here. We decide we would like to dine here as we only had a small amount of food...so we pay and pick a seat. It takes us a bit to dig in as we waited for the drinks and one of my friends went to the bathroom. As we finish our first pastry, one of the workers (a female) starts loudly yelling from the counter that they are now closed (8pm) and that we are to leave immediately. She yells a second time, literally 5 secs after her first yelling spell, that we are to leave immediately and to leave through the side door. My friends and I are floored. If they were going to kick us out at 8pm on the dot, why even offer us the option of dining in? I mean they could've just politely informed us, when we were paying, that it was better to take the pastries togo since they had to close the dining area right at 8pm. Also, yelling across the room, how rude and childish and completely unprofessional. The bakery is not that large, also it was only us and one other table left. There were 3 workers, one of them could have just come by the tables to inform us what their policy was. Though their pastries are sweet, the service left a sour aftertaste and ruined the experience."

I live 45 min away so it would be nice to know before I drive all the way there.   It just shows you don't need any more patrons. This review is for the lack of communication.

Inside looks good and everyone was so nice (still learning 'soft opening'). I got little carried away and bought little too much since everything looks great.

My wife ordered a mango frappe and the kids blending the drinks had no idea they blended part of the packaging from the mango into the ice drink. It wasn't until she had sipped 1/4 of the drink that she realized what they had done. The baristas took no responsibility for the mistake of giving us a blended mango drink with part of the packaging and the manager was the only one that apologized for the big mistake. This is unacceptable and not the best for a bakery that's just starting out. Manager, please restructure and retrain your baristas because they will cost you your business."

            "review_text": "Great atmosphere! I loved the look and feel of the place. They have a cute space for people to gather and a place to sit on wooden \"stairs\" with floor pillows. Very authentic and cozy. I would say they still could have a few additions to the upstairs seating as the plastic chairs are not very comfy. It is nice that they have a larger table on the 2nd floor though. They still have painters tape on some places but they are handling the opening really well!  Food was delicious and I'm looking forward to trying more from here, especially the milk bread! The Cranberry pastry was my favorite. The Hazelnut brittle macaron was very delicious as well. The \"Pretzel\" like pastry was warm and apple infused. It was DELICIOUS! I think they incorporated the apples very elegantly into the twist of the dough. It made every bite the perfect bite.  I think the strawberry desserts were lacking for me. The strawberry in a coussiant was advertised as cream and I was expecting more than just 'whipped' cream. The texture of the whipped cream also left a film inside my mouth which wasn't very pleasant.  The strawberry spoon (cake?) was soggy which I was not expecting and personally was not a fan. It reminded me of a Tres Leche cake.  Sweetness was perfect overall of the desserts I had.  I am not a coffee drinker and wished there was a little bit more that I could have from their drink selection. They do have smoothies though but something lighter would be nice with all the pastries.  Enjoyed my visit very much overall!"
