            "review_text": "SO impressed! MacTabby turned out to be one of our favorite stops while visiting Charlotte/Concord. I had heard of cat cafes before and while I would not consider myself a cat person (allergies) I always thought the concept was genius and would not hesitate to support it. As a result, we decided on an afternoon coffee after a hike and made the drive down to MacTabby. The cafe portion of the experience was great. The coffee flavors/options were unique and I had a hard time narrowing my selections down to something I would like because everything seemed awesome. This is separate and sectioned off so you can have your beverage in a different location and NOT socialize with the cats if you don't want to. The cat portion of the experience was so sweet. I took some allergy meds and just went for it...It was $8 for 30 minutes and the kitties were so social. Very friendly, very cute and very well cared for. Overall this was a wonderful experience that comes highly recommended if you're looking for a cat to adopt and/or just need some time with a little kitty that wants to be loved on."

I try to be courteous and move around the room so everyone, including myself, can meet all the cats. There was a couple today that hogged 4 of the most cuddly cats there, and weren't even petting them :( it left 8 of us to share about 6 cats and about half of those were skiddish and didn't like to be touched a lot, so we ended up just sitting there. This isn't Mac Tabby's fault at all. Just a reminder to everyone going. Especially since these cats are up for adoption we want everyone to get a chance to meet all the cats!!"

I called and informed them. They said they'd make it work. When we arrived the employees were not very warm or welcoming. The total opposite actually. It almost felt like we were visiting inmates at a prison with their demeanor. Didn't offer a drink, had to ask about ordering a coffee. The whole time we were in there they were just watching us intensely as we played with the cats. It was very overbearing to say the least. They then asked us to leave and didn't care to honor my whole hour. It was not special at all. Was very disappointed."

The cat room is large enough that even though there were 10 people in there, it didn't seem crowded at all. We were free to move around and visit with several of the kittens; some were sleeping, some were active and playful. I was pretty excited that we could bring toys for them as well - as soon as we got there one of them practically jumped into my bag to get the catnip mice out :) Though we didn't get anything at the cafe', I like that there was a pretty big assortment and that you could bring your selection into the cat room with you (or they'd bring it in to you if you were already there). Knowing that a small fee goes to help so many of these wonderful cats, I'd be visiting there weekly if I lived in the area. I will absolutely make another stop in the next time I'm in the area."

I know this isn't strictly the cafes fault but I witness some children being super aggressive with the cats until they almost attacked. (Ex- shoving toys in their face, putting hands and fingers in their face when they're clearly annoyed, shoving toys in the employee only room where the litter boxes are, etc.) My only suggestion is allowing slots for people that are 18+ only, just to give older people time to unwind and interact/meet with the cats without kids present. Regardless awesome and friendly staff and great selection of drinks and cute kitties!"

After the owners response, I realize my judgement was wrong.  I'm all for the profits for the kitties.  Update: I was able to finally go to for a reservation with the kitties! I was excited, but sad to find all of them were wiped from hours of play in the morning. Several kitties had URIs (Upper Respiratory Infection), which typically requires medicine and quarantine, so many of them were lethargic and sleepy and sick. I cleaned up some of their eye crusties, poor babies. I know it's just like the flu, so it's easily spreadable. I also disagree with the amount of people and time that were spent around the cats. The poor things need a break from so much interaction. Every 30 min to an hour, there about 8 people in the room at a time; maybe not always, but enough to exhaust these babies. I feel so bad for them."

They have a large room for the visits. If you don't book for a private hour, they are currently letting in 12 people per hour. It looked pretty crowded for my comfort during covid. Most people were wearing masks but not all and since they have drinks, folks are taking them up and down. Pre Covid, they let in 15 people per hour."

We even ended up adopting one of the cats that we really clicked with. He's been with us since Summer 2019 and he's really settled into the home life. The adoption process gave us no issues and it was great to get to know the cat first-hand.  The coffee here is also really good. Despite the many cats (which are kept separate from the cafe area), the whole area is spotless and exceptionally clean. I can't recommend this cafe enough to anyone who likes animals, good coffee, or both.  I didn't think to take any photos of the cafe, but I did include a picture of our adopted cat, Khoshekh (formerly known as Rustin)."

I really adored one cat (Cooper) but sadly cannot adopt him right now, one day I plan to come with the chance of adopting but not today. I love all of the Cafe's furniture pieces and cat toys. The cats were all slouched on their towers and were s cute! The coffee was great too. The adoption rate is amazing, almost 474 as I recall. I recommend to and can't wait for my next visit!!!!"

The facility is super clean with no cat smell or messes anywhere. They have a cute beverage/coffee/snack bar and the cafe part is separate from the cats, so you can get a nice treat and just watch the cats through the windows or enjoy the NoDa view. This place is a lifesaver for people like me who have kids that love cats and don't have one, all while supporting a wonderful cause and place of business."

They seem to go even further helping with the cat population too. While we were there,  3 cats were going to their furever homes and 2 cats were coming in from area rescues. It was incredibly clean, I saw not even one cat hair, never saw nor smelled a litter box and the cats are healthy. Not all the cats love the attention,  some were skittish,  sometimes you just need to be patient!  Great experience!"

The employees, while very helpful and kind, have no idea what cats have applications on them or have already been promised to a family, and it is not listed on their website, nor the website of the rescue.  If you want to avoid having your heart set on a cat that has basically already been adopted, the best action to take is to submit an application, wait for it to be accepted, and then visit the cat cafe. I believe they adopt on Thursday nights so if you go on a Friday there shouldn't be any cats that have already been adopted.  If you just want some warm drinks and kitty time, however, it is a good experience. The cats are sweet and the employees are nice, in addition to it being an overall cute environment. You may want to visit on weekdays before 3pm however, to avoid large groups of people, and the stress of watching schoolchildren manhandle the cats."

If you are looking to adopt a cat then I don't recommend in the slightest, they have a very thorough application process that takes a few days of being ignored, an email to ask about your application status, and a response telling you that they apologise but the cat you applied for has been adopted already so they overlook your application. So if you want to adopt a cat here, you have to preapply so you give away all of your information with no guarantee of getting the kitten you want to adopt; there is little to no communication on application statuses and no one at the cat Cafe is aware of which cats have pending applications. So if you want to just drink coffee and pet cats, then this place is 5 stars, if you want to adopt from a place that is aware of their cats situation and are informed on the subject, then go somewhere else to adopt."

The drinks we had before tasted great and were reasonably priced. The employees were what really made Mac Tabby special. They were kind and seemed excited to be there. They told us about the cats names and fun facts about them. I'm not even a cat person but I really liked the environment and mood of the place. I love seeing when animals are taken care of properly and are happy. It was a great experience that I would 100% recommend to anyone."

I loved that the staff stayed present to ensure the safety and comfort of the animals and they had their own kitty escape door where they could wander off to if they decided they were done being social (the cats, not the staff, lol).

We chose this place because it was open until 9:00 pm!!  When we first entered the cat playroom, four cats ran up to greet us. There were 12 cats in total. They were eager to play or snuggle next to your foot. Only downside is you can't pick em up, though it's okay if they decide to sit in your lap.  It was such a chill vibe and great to close your eyes and destress with soft jazz. It was a Starbucks Java atmosphere with relaxed cats (cafe was separate!!) Paid $8 for bottled beverage which was $$, but there were more affordable snacks on the menu.  In playroom, lots of toys, and snuggly, comfy carpets and places for humans and cats to sit. Surprised that it did NOT smell like cats or stinky tho sometimes you could smell kitty boo-boo if the litter room swung open. Employees work hard to keep it clean and fresh smelling. They even gave us treats and catnip to give the kitties."

I like that they limit visitors to keep the cats from being too stressed. I also like that they don't allow you to pick up cats, in order to reduce their stress.  My only complaints are the ambiance and acoustics. The music is a little too loud and I worry that it would be a bit much for the cats (people can be loud to be heard over the music). The music seems to cover up the echoes of the wood floors - I really think adding some carpets and playing quieter, calm music (classical/jazz?) would do better for the cats' well-being. To be clear, I'm not accusing anyone of mistreating the cats!  My girlfriend I and had a lot of fun and were very happy to support rescue cats. Would definitely go again!!"

The coffee was the worst I've ever had, I looked up the cost of the furniture that decorated the place....and let's just say I'm not sure cats need a $700 plastic orange console table.  There also isn't any private location for the cats. If they are  tired or need a break the climb into cat beds.  I witnessed one if the women lift one of the encouragecat beds and wake the cat up to encourage play with a customer. I saw another encourage a cat to leave the litter box room to rejoin the others.  People were touching sleeping cats.  As a cat owner and an avid TNR this place just disappointed me.  I felt like something that was meant to be good and positive for the cats had been turned into a hip, profitable idea.  The point and meaning of true adoption and fostering had been commercialized and the cats had been forced into a petting zoo of modern urban sorts."

            "review_text": "This place is awesome!  Allergy Warning! They have an air freshener on in the cat room and they use catnip with the cats. (I will say that while the air freshener was strong, it was wasn't overpowering)  I took my roommate for her birthday. I'm super allergic to cats and catnip so we don't have pets in the house.  She loved it. There is a separate room away from the cafe but you can see into the cat room.  The bathroom was clean and was big enough for people with movement issues. If you can make it up the flight of stairs, you'll be fine. There was also a bar next to the toilet for those that need it.  The cafe is mostly drinks but they do have a few snacks. It seemed a little pricey, but compaired to other animal cafe's I've been to they were about average.  The people who work there are friendly and helpful but not pushy or invasive. They answered all of our questions and knew a lot about each cat.  I was happy to see that they made sure to stay in the room with the cats when there were people inside. 2 workers were there and one would always stay inside. It was clear they were making sure that no one hurt the cats. They were gentle but firm with the little girl who was there at the same time as we were but who thought tugging on their tails would be a good way to get their attention. I was very impressed by how the employee handled that situation.  The cat area itself is really clean. REALLY REALLY CLEAN. As someone who has cat allergies and was going as a birthday surprise for my roommate I was excessively surprised by how the place was kept up. Kitty litter is not in the public area, and none of the furniture has cat hair just sitting in little piles. As far as I could tell nothing was dusty and the room was cool. There were plently of chairs, cat toys, and things to play with.  I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!"

I can tell that everyone cares so deeply about the well-being of each feline resident, and it's no wonder they have so much success with adoptions. It's hard not to fall in love with the kitties as you get to interact with them for 30-60 minutes, and truly see their personalities this way, rather than in a shelter with cages. The work they do with Catering to Cats and Dogs is wonderful! (Also, the coffees and teas are yummy)"

If your kids aren't familiar with cats then temper their expectations. Cats aren't dogs cats aren't looking forward to playing with humans.

I can't lie) to spoil forever but because of Mac Tabby - I am confident that each kitty is going to find their perfect family soon. <3 I truly can't wait to go back and visit a new bunch of playful sweethearts.

She picked me at the cafe and didn't want me to go away. She loves her toys and loves to play fetch. Unfortunately after about a month of having her and several vet appointments it was determined that Bella needed 8 teeth removed due to a disease early in her life. After this surgery though Bella was feeling much better and was no longer in pain. She was able to come out of her shell and loves to talk haha. Mac Tabby Cat Cafe was a great environment for all of the cats there. The only thing I would caution anyone about is be sure to read the health information for the cat you are picking. Although Bella looked to be in good health, she was having the issues with her teeth, as well as a few other little issues.  Other than this enjoy your new pet!!"

If you're a cat lover, don't think twice about booking a reservation at Mac Tabby - especially if you're looking to adopt a new kitty. It's refreshing to see them running about and enjoying themselves, rather than stuck in a small cage in a miserable environment.  The staff was also excellent! They were very attentive to all the cats' specific needs, which was awesome to see! You can tell they genuinely enjoy working there, and the cats love it there as well. :-)  Only thing that can be improved is the coffee/drink/food selection. It's worth mentioning that I may be biased here after visiting some other more established cat cafes in other cities though. This place is only going to get better as time goes on!"

For an hour at a time, you are in a room with a bunch of cats and toys for them to play with. the cat lounge area has plenty of comfortable seating, a lot of natural lighting and cats. It was a fun experience and would recommend this for kids and adults as a fun activity together."
