I called and informed them. They said they'd make it work. When we arrived the employees were not very warm or welcoming. The total opposite actually. It almost felt like we were visiting inmates at a prison with their demeanor. Didn't offer a drink, had to ask about ordering a coffee. The whole time we were in there they were just watching us intensely as we played with the cats. It was very overbearing to say the least. They then asked us to leave and didn't care to honor my whole hour. It was not special at all. Was very disappointed."

The cat room is large enough that even though there were 10 people in there, it didn't seem crowded at all. We were free to move around and visit with several of the kittens; some were sleeping, some were active and playful. I was pretty excited that we could bring toys for them as well - as soon as we got there one of them practically jumped into my bag to get the catnip mice out :) Though we didn't get anything at the cafe', I like that there was a pretty big assortment and that you could bring your selection into the cat room with you (or they'd bring it in to you if you were already there). Knowing that a small fee goes to help so many of these wonderful cats, I'd be visiting there weekly if I lived in the area. I will absolutely make another stop in the next time I'm in the area."

I know this isn't strictly the cafes fault but I witness some children being super aggressive with the cats until they almost attacked. (Ex- shoving toys in their face, putting hands and fingers in their face when they're clearly annoyed, shoving toys in the employee only room where the litter boxes are, etc.) My only suggestion is allowing slots for people that are 18+ only, just to give older people time to unwind and interact/meet with the cats without kids present. Regardless awesome and friendly staff and great selection of drinks and cute kitties!"

I didn't even buy anything, just a space that they could easily fill as the place was packed. Not giving a refund doesn't make sense."

After the owners response, I realize my judgement was wrong.  I'm all for the profits for the kitties.  Update: I was able to finally go to for a reservation with the kitties! I was excited, but sad to find all of them were wiped from hours of play in the morning. Several kitties had URIs (Upper Respiratory Infection), which typically requires medicine and quarantine, so many of them were lethargic and sleepy and sick. I cleaned up some of their eye crusties, poor babies. I know it's just like the flu, so it's easily spreadable. I also disagree with the amount of people and time that were spent around the cats. The poor things need a break from so much interaction. Every 30 min to an hour, there about 8 people in the room at a time; maybe not always, but enough to exhaust these babies. I feel so bad for them."

The private hour with cats compared to the other cat cafe in Charlotte is more pricey, but Mac Tabby is open longer/more days and has a lot to offer in the heart of NoDa before and/or after the cat visit.  They have a large room for the visits. If you don't book for a private hour, they are currently letting in 12 people per hour. It looked pretty crowded for my comfort during covid. Most people were wearing masks but not all and since they have drinks, folks are taking them up and down. Pre Covid, they let in 15 people per hour."

We even ended up adopting one of the cats that we really clicked with. He's been with us since Summer 2019 and he's really settled into the home life. The adoption process gave us no issues and it was great to get to know the cat first-hand.  The coffee here is also really good. Despite the many cats (which are kept separate from the cafe area), the whole area is spotless and exceptionally clean. I can't recommend this cafe enough to anyone who likes animals, good coffee, or both.  I didn't think to take any photos of the cafe, but I did include a picture of our adopted cat, Khoshekh (formerly known as Rustin)."

I really adored one cat (Cooper) but sadly cannot adopt him right now, one day I plan to come with the chance of adopting but not today. I love all of the Cafe's furniture pieces and cat toys. The cats were all slouched on their towers and were s cute! The coffee was great too. The adoption rate is amazing, almost 474 as I recall. I recommend to and can't wait for my next visit!!!!"

This was the perfect place to take them to get their cat fix for the day, while I was able to sit back and enjoy my coffee while they played. The facility is super clean with no cat smell or messes anywhere. They have a cute beverage/coffee/snack bar and the cafe part is separate from the cats, so you can get a nice treat and just watch the cats through the windows or enjoy the NoDa view. This place is a lifesaver for people like me who have kids that love cats and don't have one, all while supporting a wonderful cause and place of business."

            "review_text": "**caution to those who want to adopt** There is very poor communication between the cafe and the rescue that they use. The employees, while very helpful and kind, have no idea what cats have applications on them or have already been promised to a family, and it is not listed on their website, nor the website of the rescue.  If you want to avoid having your heart set on a cat that has basically already been adopted, the best action to take is to submit an application, wait for it to be accepted, and then visit the cat cafe. I believe they adopt on Thursday nights so if you go on a Friday there shouldn't be any cats that have already been adopted.  If you just want some warm drinks and kitty time, however, it is a good experience. The cats are sweet and the employees are nice, in addition to it being an overall cute environment. You may want to visit on weekdays before 3pm however, to avoid large groups of people, and the stress of watching schoolchildren manhandle the cats."

If you are looking to adopt a cat then I don't recommend in the slightest, they have a very thorough application process that takes a few days of being ignored, an email to ask about your application status, and a response telling you that they apologise but the cat you applied for has been adopted already so they overlook your application. So if you want to adopt a cat here, you have to preapply so you give away all of your information with no guarantee of getting the kitten you want to adopt; there is little to no communication on application statuses and no one at the cat Cafe is aware of which cats have pending applications. So if you want to just drink coffee and pet cats, then this place is 5 stars, if you want to adopt from a place that is aware of their cats situation and are informed on the subject, then go somewhere else to adopt."
