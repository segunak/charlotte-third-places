I was okay with that as I know it's two shots of espresso with milk, not meant to be a large drink. But that small 6oz cup was only half full when they gave it to me. You pay extra for non-dairy milk and I feel like I got maybe a splash at best of almond milk. Not worth the $5 I paid for 3oz of coffee."

I found the staff, inattentive, lackidasical, and  slightly rude.  The attitude was \"I could give shxx what you want...\".  A simple inquiry about any brewed coffee was scorned.  I didn't have time to wait for a pour-over.  I ordered a hot latte - 2 shots, less than 12 oz of milk.  Purely tasteless and over $6 bucks.  What a waste.  I never intend to return."

Response to owner's comment First of all if hot large beverages are served in the 16 oz cups then the cold without ice should also be served in the correct size cups. When I asked your barista about the drink she respond stating the cup was not filled because of the ice. You and your employees should inform customers of the cups they are getting are not same when requesting no ice, hot and cold are different. I did not have a foul mouth. Your barista could not explain why but you did in your post. Another issue one of your barista insisted my daughter use her pin when paying for her drinks. I've never had to use it at your store."

I ordered my drink in a mug that I brought- a capuccino with chocolate- or you could call it a mocha with dry milk, I suppose. The barista made it for me, and literally 5 seconds after I sat down, they informed me, as well as the other customers, that they were ‚Äúclosing their indoor seating‚Äù in 5 minutes at 6:00. There goes my evening. At least they could have told me they were closing before I ordered my drink. I ordered it in a regular mug, not a travel one or anything, which I would think is a pretty clear sign I intend to stay. It doesn't even say anywhere on their website or Instagram that their indoor seating closes early. At least make it evident if you're going to do that. I wasted an hour of my evening and 6$ because of misleading hours. And I wouldn't have said anything, but while we're at it, the drink was pretty mediocre. Could barely taste the espresso. I volunteered to pay for a large despite my mug being probably between 10 and 12 ounces. Just tasted like cocoa and too much, too dry milk- and I'm a barista, so I know what a good mocha or cappuccino tastes like. Also, there was no latte art, which definitely isn't expected, but it's another missed opportunity to make my experience more enjoyable. I only bought it because I wanted to hang out, which I was unable to do. I'll just say it didn't make up for the rest of my experience.  Just disappointing. The barista was pleasant, but failed to provide me with the most basic and extremely relevant information. If you're going to have some kind of different indoor seating hours, at least advertise it well- unless the baristas are lying to make people leave early, which is, you know, worse. The customer shouldn't have to go out of their way to discover your secret hours. Probably will never go back."

(Thank you for thinking about diabetic people or with other conditions).  It's overpriced for the taste of the coffee.  I don't understand what people find here.  Outside was more than 90 degrees and you have 3 little tables for 2. A place with two chairs and a small couch, And a little bar beside the window.  Bathrooms are locked. So you need to ask for a code from any employee. And the place was dirty and packed.  My friend paid $12,99 for a small plain black coffee and a muffin. I didn't know if I was in NY or Charlotte lol.  Not worthy for me and never come back. There are small much better family businesses than this chain, that have more merchandise to sell instead of coffee."

I am so glad that they made it through the pandemic/shutdown and have continued to provide a great atmosphere and quality coffee / products.  It is my go-to coffee place, and I'm very fortunate (as a resident in Waverly) to have a beautiful hole-in-the-wall coffee shop to spend quality time in.  If you haven't been here, try any of their frozen drinks!!  So good... My staples are also the iced lavender latte (with oat milk), and the blackberry coffee lemonade during the summer.  Absolutely TO DIE FOR!!  Thank you Moka crew for all you guys are to this community!"

I would really consider having someone that is better at customer service and being friendly to people work your register. It was a great latte!

They had a great selection of coffees, the vibe of the shop was awesome, there was good seating, and it was clean and well kept. The reason I can't give a full five stars is because the baristas were extremely rude. They looked thoroughly displeased to be serving us and everyone else who walked in, and were VERY short and dismissive in their interactions; not just with us but with everyone who came in after us, too. Their demeanor only changed when someone they knew came in; otherwise they honestly just seemed annoyed that any of us were there. The other minor issue we had was that the WiFi was extremely slow and kept cutting out, which made working there pretty difficult."

So I've never tried anything else, but I genuinely plan to. Eventually. üòÖ  There's a Sta***cks in the same shopping centre, and if you're still going there after Moka opened, you're crazy... For basically the same pricing, you could be getting actually delicious coffee from people who know how to brew coffee. Instead you waste your money and treat time on the fact that Sta***cks has a drive-thru?! I understand, sometimes you're on the way to work. But so are the 10 other people in line at that drive-thru every morning... It's really not that difficult to park in one of the abundant spaces at Waverly near Moka, and get out of your car for the amount of time you'd have waited in the drive-thru line, if you're gonna get coffee.  And when you're not in a rush? There's no excuse for sub-par coffee. I used to go to Sta***cks before Moka opened, but then, there were no good, independent coffee shops around locally with superior product.  Now there is."

I dont care that much about it, except if i'm paying a ridiculous price for a latte it better be perfect.  No comfortable seats. Pews look cool, but they're not the most comfortable to sit in.  Good ambiance overall.  Music choice was terrible- luckily wasn't very loud, but i'm not looking to listen to club music while reading a book and drinking coffee."
