The atmosphere and decor was spot on and perfect. It was cozy and comfy and just overall a great vibe along with fantastic coffee. I was skeptical when Waterbean bought it, but thought I would still try it out. They have completely ruined the warmth in this coffee shop while trying to convert it to a \"modern\" coffee shop. It's all white and plain. There's no life to the place anymore. It's boring, bland and cold in its style. When I look for a place to spend time I want somewhere inviting and cozy. This place just no longer has that. The way it was when it was \"Unwind\" was perfect. They captured every aspect of what a coffee shop should be. It's a bummer Waterbean isn't able to hold onto that. On top of that, their coffee is subpar at best and I wish they still had the many tea options as before. It made the place unique. Now it's just another boring chain coffee shop."

I know Waterbean renovated in Nov, but the atmosphere and furniture are very industrial and not cozy like I would expect for a coffee shop. I got a specialty holiday-themed latte and it was over $6. I've never paid that much for a small latte before. The regular small latte was, I believe, $5.30. I used treat myself to a nice coffee every Sunday, but unfortunately I can't justify spending $6+."

The latte came out meh making me want to give up on coffee shops altogether. Place was a little dirty. When i asked for napkins they said they have some and when I looked it was just dirty crumbled napkins left. I said it's empty and when she refilled she put the dirty crumbled napkins on top.

The coffe was good, the matcha was good and the strawberry green tea was brewed correctly and was great! A little later we brought 4 more drinks. 1 tea we threw out immediately after a sip, another we added almost 2 tbs of sugar to improve it...didn't work. 3rd was so bitter it reminded me of wormwood. 4th was so mild in flavor it tasted simply of boiled water. All the last 4 teas tasted really burnt/over brewed and bitter. I guess that since they got busier during the 2nd order they weren't able to deliver the same quality. I expected a consistent good quality for their drinks since that's their specialty so it really threw me off with how the drinks were all over the place. About the food; muffin was great, pizza mid, chicken salad fresh but dry, and the wrap was good. The upside to it all was that the staff were present and the whole cafe was kept clean."

The coffee was barely luke-warm and when I asked if it could be heated up they microwaved it in their office for over 5 minutes. Being a trained barista, I was hopeful that request would prompt someone to brew a new batch of coffee; I was mistaken. As I waited for my coffee to be assaulted by the microwave, the manager/owner asked if she could help me. I informed her I was already being helped, but the reason was because the coffee was not hot. Her response: \"oh okay.\" I was appalled. A coffeeshop should never, ever be okay with microwaving someone's coffee. I would rate the coffee a D. Even when it was hot, it wasn't a good flavor. Cleanliness is an A++. Atmosphere is an A, when the staff is quiet. Staff about a B+; they were more concerned with chatting to themselves than helping customers. Overall, I would not recommend this establishment."

As you walk in you can smell the spectacular aromas from coffee, tea, and food. The nice chill music playing around the cafe makes the relaxed calming vibe even better. First opinion was the cafe was very clean and covid compliant. So many options for their drinks/food but definitely not overwhelming. I would say the perfect selection for their style here. Decided to try the cold brew for my coffee of choice. The cold brew was a perfect blend, didn't taste watered down like Starbucks gets and was able to enjoy it for the entire time spent at the cafe. Also decided to try the hummus and veggies plate. The hummus was so savory with the oil and pepper blend topping. The veggies tasted just as fresh as they looked. Almost like they were just picked. The decor here definitely  helped with me keep my concentrate while I was working. Loved the wall with different selections of teas. The customer service or should I say guest experience was spectacular, very friendly and nice. Will be a regular spot. Was so pleased about this cafe that I had to write my review on the spot!!"

They have an immaculate tea selection and delicious pour overs and handled out order with the utmost care and kindness even when they had a bit of a line and were super sweet as we left.
