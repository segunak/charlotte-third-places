Truth be told he comped me an extra because he said he liked me. That is true customer service right there, and that beer was my favorite, took one to go AND bought and awesome button down shirt for my hubby. Long story short , My experience with both locations was positive and for those that may have been apart of my experience will be happy to know that the 2X shirt ended up fitting!!!

We went to the place just before their kitchen closing time but not the brewery, we ordered sambal wings which is their garlic pepper sauce and the brat dumplings. We received buffalo wings instead of the sambal wings. I didn't really mind since it was very late but the wings itself were chewy. Dumplings were okay. We also couple of beers psychic dynamite (west coast ipa) beer and it was very good and another one called old world. I think this was a barrel aged ipa and it had a unique taste and I personally wasn't a fan of it."

After last night my view and fondness for this place have been completely destroyed.  Their managers Joe and Tj are very condescending and defended their bar back who was on the clock for threatening my friend. I would suggest Keaton be fired for how he acted while on the clock at his job. Your place of business is not your own private brewey or a plave to be possive over your girl friend while you work when nobody was hitting on her.  Trust me she wasnt our type....we sat in the public area and wanted to watch duke vs unc...needless to say i will happily give my money to other local brewries who appreciate professionalism and their customers.  I am a busuness owner myself and i expect thing from my employees the same i do myself. So without hesitation.  Treating my buisness like your own and doing as you please would have that employee  gagaga gone!!!  I rekon the bar back feild can be hard to get into and find replacements for.  God Bless."

Their patio is great for dogs and the heaters leave you feeling toasty on a cold day. The food is quick and delicious. Plenty of seating and a large bar top that's accessible from the patio. I could go on and on about this place!  P.s. try to find street parking somewhere around the block."

It was crowded so I waited for about 10 minutes(which I didn't mind) Got to the bar and the manager came over to help. He was extremely aggressive when asking what I needed. I asked for my bill and to get a crowler. He yelled that they don't do crowlers inside and to go outside even though I'd been waiting. I went outside to stand at the window and he came back yelling again that I was at the wrong window. I finally got someone besides him and they were pleasant to deal with.  Great beer but whomever the manager is(shaved or short hair and beard) has some anger issues and should just stay away from customers and let the staff handle things."

Ordered the duck quesadilla with fries, waited, waited,  and waited some more. The kitchen didn't appear to be particularly busy. Finally checked on our food after multiple people who ordered after us got their food. Ours was waiting and the cashier said that it had been waiting for fries, which must have meant that they were waiting for the fries to cool down because they were barely room temperature. The quesadilla had a little warmth, so we kept that and I took the fries back. The man at the counter gave me more fries, but they were from a bowl sitting on the kitchen counter and were a little warmer, but not very good. Fries need to be served fresh, especially when you're not busy. Very disappointing. Maybe it was a bad day in the kitchen, but they didn't seem to care very much about what they were sending out. We'll probably return for the beer, but no second chance for the food. There are lots of other places to eat in Charlotte."

They make a great sour beer line and I'd recommend thicket as thieves as one of the better sours around.

Her \"I don't give a sh.t factor\" seemed to be on full display.  So it was your typical \"what do you want?\"  Thank God I paid in cash because I am not sure she could poor beers and remember to run a card within a 5 minute span.  We paid way too much for a round of beers that tasted like tree bark.  Then we sat down for a surprise party...there were noise makers and such at a table in the back.  We began to blow the noise makers and a kid no older than 22 told us to quit making noise in a bar full of narcissists trying to out-selfy each other.  Apparently having a surprise party for an old friend was putting a bad vibe for the plastic people in this establishment.  So we tried to wash down the tree bark ale before it got warm and we left approximately 30 minutes after arrial.  Let's just say...I won't be back.  The only reason why I gave this 3 stars is because small businesses like this one make a difference in the community.  If you want to impress your young plastic date...take her here.  She will be impressed.  If you want a good time.. good tunes...good food...good beers...good vibes...not as many fake people...go to Macs on south."

We sat at our table for over ten minutes while the female and male bartender we behind the bar talking and not pouring drinks. They were literally looking right at us and pretended like we were not there. The sad part was that it was raining  and not at all busy. We were also starving and the menu looked OK but it stated we had to go outside in the rain to order from a food truck and would be paged when our food was ready. Lame! Ended up going to a place called Manchester 1812 down the street. Staff was great, food was great! We were a party of ten and our bill came out to $ 500 with a tip."

It's communal seating in the back, which I personally enjoy because you can always start up convos w/fellow beer enthusiasts and as they say \"strangers are just friends you haven't met yet\".  They were packed the Friday night I went, but the bartenders were quick and attentive and they seemed to go out of their way to make sure anyone standing at the bar had been helped.  I did the sampler flight of 5 beers. They give decent pours and you can choose any of their beer offerings. I liked that they had a variety of styles and I also liked that they didn't up charge you for the boozier/high abv beers. Needless to say, my flight choices were the big abv beers and they were all delicious! I had had a few of their staples at various beer bars and restaurants in town, but it was nice to see some of the \"only at the brewery\" options.  Will definitely be back to see what's new on tap!"

Nice amount of tables and two bars with an eclectic vibe. Nice selection on tap and their brews are very good. No waiters her so you have to visit the bars. We ordered the bosshog mac&cheese egg roll from Twisted Eats and was not a fan. It was very greasy and wasn't very tasty. The fries were terrific but no ketchup available. They used some light sauce. I did see other items coming from the kitchen that looked good. Overall I figure a good hangout for locals within walking distance."

Not exactly sure what warranted the latter, maybe the fact that someone was having a bad hurricane induced day, who knows. But it was off putting right from the start and I couldn't drink my beer fast enough to get out of there. I added 1 star for the other bartender being nice and also took a few crowlers home with me so that the beer (the one I originally intended to enjoy inside) can be given another chance. Weird, uncomfortable and not welcoming overall. Also, the whole ‚Äúnot filling up other growlers‚Äù trend didn't last long even in NorCal, so let's see how long it lasts here, with a ton of friendly breweries literally right around the corner  EDIT: beer is actually pretty descent"

Tastes like raw fried flour...tough...gross. Grilled cheese...the cheese is unevenly distributed on the bread...so every bite tastes like a different sandwich. Not blended well at all.  Last time I came, I got the Chinatown chicken salad and it was missing all the ingredients. No edamae no crispy noodles.  Please work on matching your menu to what you serve and season your food!

I was honestly a little disappointed. There food was good, but not as good as I was expecting it to be. I got the chicken sandwich and fried cauliflower. The chicken sandwich was just ok. It was a little dry and kind of lacked flavor. The fried cauliflower was pretty good, but nothing that special. Two people at my table got the grilled cheese and thought it was just ok. They said it wasn't cheesy enough. The one thing that really stood out were the brussels sprouts. They were some of the best I've had.  While the restaurant does have its own space, they will also serve you the full menu from the brewery which is really nice.  If I was hungry while at the brewery, I would get food again, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come to the restaurant."
