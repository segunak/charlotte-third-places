I only wish I would of gotten her name. She was about 5'5, slender, beautiful black lady. She answered all my questions and was so patient. Today, when I went back, I was using the computer lab and again was struggling with an issue. Today, the lady that   was working, when I went to her for assistance, she appeared to not want to help me. After explaining what the problem was three times, I asked her if maybe she could just come and look at it. She made EVERY excuse to not come help, but finally agreed to. When we got into the Computer Lab, she stood so far back from the computer she seriously could not see what I was talking about. Both of us were wearing mask, so I can't think it was a \"Covid \" concern. I  finally just gave up. It was not worth getting frustrated over. Too bad I didn't get her name either, but her name badge was flipped backwards. She was about 5'3, white, and maybe mid-30s."

We've been at this for 15 months now. The mask mandate has been lifted. If the vaccine works, why are you requiring people to wear masks? Why don't you have an option for pickup for people who can't or won't come inside? Inconvenient location. Hope it does close."
