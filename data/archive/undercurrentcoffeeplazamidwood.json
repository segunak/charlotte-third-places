I understand if it is busy but I did not wait in line to order and there appeared to be a few online orders. While waiting for 20 min I watched the four baristas chat, sample multiple drinks, and have no urgency. This drink was ordered to-go at 7:40 am… when people have to get to work. #CentralCoffeeCo"

Either out front at one of the tables with my bicycle, or I'd lock up at the rack and sit at the bar overlooking the barista area.  I typically like to sit where I can watch the baristas working.  When I catch myself admiring their productivity it snaps me back to my own toil.  Either job applications, coursework, or if I'm lucky, just a book I'm reading.  It was during my second week sitting in this seat when one of the baristas acknowledged me for the first time.  “Do you think we're funny?”  she asked, assuming that I had been listening in on their conversation.  “I do.” I hadn't been listening that time, but I've listened before and watched them enough to know that they were.  I've often worked in service jobs or been a patron in service environments where the staff do not particularly enjoy being around each other.  Most times it's hardly perceptible, but you can always tell when a group of employees are friends.  And it's a wonderful thing to be a part of.  And that's what I go to Undercurrent coffee for.  The baristas will learn your name, and use it.  They'll remember your order and know what to recommend if you'd like to try something new.  But above all, they'll be really kind."

I got an iced latte in one of their glass cups and was really disappointed in the espresso to milk ratio. I could barely taste the espresso, way too milky, and just a few pieces of ice. I love that they shake the iced drinks but I didn't end up finishing mine. My husband got a cortado and it was much better than my drink. The daily quiche was fantastic and the breakfast sandwich was good but not spectacular. We sat at the bar and watched the baristas work, their flow was really fun to watch and they're very good at making drinks but someone should rethink how much milk goes into an iced latte. Not sure if it was an accident that morning or what because I've gotten iced lattes from this location (to-go) that weren't as weak."

The coffee we ordered lattes (didn't mention that we wanted iced) so we received them hot so we asked for ice and poured the hot coffee over the ice It wasn't the best but that's on us so be sure to communicate! W your barista. The service was slow despite it not being busy, and 2 drinks were remade during our visit which sort of had me worried at that point. The food I had a PB & banana on toast, my gf had the breakfast sandwich and she said the eggs were fluffy but the sandwich was slightly cold. We would have asked for a remake or so but we had an appt to attend."

I ordered an almond milk latte, but they didn't have almond milk, so I went with the oat milk latte for a little over $5 and it was delicious!  Staff: I received good service on a busy weekday at 1:30PM.  Seating: There's couches and cushioned individual seats at the front, which seats about 9 people. The utensils, napkins, and water are located near the couches. There's one 4-5 seater table located next to the bar seats. A divider book shelf separates the front of the coffee shop, and there's maybe 10 more seats in the back portion near their “lab” and the restrooms. For a busy weekday, there were still open seats in the back portion of the shop where there's plenty of wall outlets for electronics, but I wouldn't recommend this setting for a group meeting since there aren't a lot of tables where you can face each other. They didn't have outdoor porch seating the day I came, but it is an option on other days, but those are still hard to snatch up. I recommend coming around 4PM. That was the least busiest time if you want to grab coffee and work on something real quick.  Parking: It's tough to find parking in this whole area. Their back parking lot has 6 spots and a handicap spot. I circled around and eventually found a spot off the street where you have to back in. For those spots, if you don't back in, it's a $25 fine just FYI.  Internet: Sadly, it wasn't working the day I came. I logged into another establishment's WiFi, but it did slow me down based on productivity due to poor connection. The ambiance and music volume at the establishment was okay. It didn't interfere with me focusing. I stayed 2.5 hours, read, and worked using my phone the rest of the time.  Restrooms: One of the restrooms was missing a handle, so the large hole had brown paper towel stuffed in it for privacy? The other bathroom was tidy. I would just recommend a good floor scrubbing/power wash to get the dirt off from between the tiles.  Though the Internet had network issues and the food was a miss for me, I'd come again to get another drink and try a new entree."

            "review_text": "Undercurrent Coffee NAILS everything! From all the obvious things you'd want to the smallest details you didn't even know would add to your coffee shop experience, I was truly impressed. Visiting from Southern California, we're not lacking in coffee shops and as a student I've visited a ton over the last few years, but Undercurrent has distanced itself as my best coffee shop experience to date!  COFFEE / FOOD Delicious! Not only is their drip fresh and their lattes beautifully crafted, they offer a relatively large menu of options including non-caffeinated drinks and speciality drinks. Their coffee is a smooth, balanced experience and you really can't go wrong with their offerings. You can really appreciate their creativity in some of their drink. As for the food, while it might not blow you away, they have a number of brunch options including a grits bowl that isn't too bad.  SERVICE Every worker I've come across so far has been pleasant and helpful. I've had no issues and even when there was a power outage for a time, the workers were very accommodating to allow customers to still hangout inside while other nearby business closed down completely.  AMBIENCE / AMENITIES This is probably where Undercurrent shines the most! Inside, you'll find a spacious, clean, and modern shop accentuated by large windows and tungsten lighting that invite a remarkably warm atmosphere. I love the minimalistic feel of the whole place.  As for amenities, they offer a number of seating options from couches towards the front, a community work table in the middle, and small tables towards the back. Bar seating throughout. At each spot, you'll find conveniently placed outlets. Seating is comfortable and the desks are wooden in texture (I hate glossy/glass tables). Parking can be limited but there are no time limits on the main street!  Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend Undercurrent Coffee! Really wish we had this place in SoCal--it would be my absolute go-to for meetups, studying, or just to relax. Go check them out!"

After spending +$8 on the drinks before a tip you would expect a great drink or at the very least the correct ones. I'm not going to hold it against them but they should reconsider their hiring process to make sure they hire people who understand the differences between a cappuccino and a latte instead of \"winging it\".

It was surprising to me how much space there was inside and how much of it was not your typical hard surfaced bare-bones chair and table. The setting is relaxed and comfortable. I had a pour-over and a cortado which I thought great! The onyx coffee is well known in the coffee world and they brewed it respectfully, bringing out citrusy and ripe fruit notes of the coffee. All in all it was great, the only downfall I had was that there were awkward exchanges between the barista and a customer that were confrontational, intimate (in a familiar, non-sexual way), and noticeable."

The coffee is just \"meh,\" food options are limited, expensive and trendy, and the outdoor seating is shameful (no umbrellas...really? It's Charlotte, NC.  It tends to get hot here...umbrellas are kind of a no-brainer necessity).  The counter person was bland and unfriendly, and I paid almost $3 for a black coffee. Come on.  In all fairness to this place, coffee and coffee-drink pricing is out of control everywhere.  I guess it's really our fault, as patrons, for continuing to pay $5 and $6 for drinks that should be $2.50 - just to be able to get out and socialize and meet people.  And I guess I wouldn't mind shelling out that much if the coffee drinks were top-notch. But it's not.  Not here anyway."

The Farmer's Bowl is incredible and one of my new favorite dishes in the city. I gave 5 stars cause I want them to win, but my only suggestion is for some tweaks on price point. Neighborhood spots should try to find a healthy balance between hipster-on-a-budget and ballin-out-banker-bro. 5 bucks for a cold brew in a tiny ass glass is not the balance I was looking for. I need unrealistically large amounts of coffee to prepare myself to meet the day's challenges, and this lil shot glass of brew didn't cut it. Reeally good tasting coffee though! :)"
