There was no wait for a table, but it did take a while for our food to come out. When we ordered, they said there were only 5 biscuits left, but they were open until 3:00, so I'm not sure why they wouldn't just make more. Luckily, we ordered in time to get the last biscuits.  Here's what I tried: - Veggie Omelet ($9.95): The omelet was really good! It came packed with veggies. I got it with a biscuit and home fries. The biscuit was buttered perfectly and was sooo delicious. The potatoes were seasoned really well and tasted great, but I wish they were crispy on the outside. - Regular Stack of Chocolate Chip Pancakes ($7.25 + $1.75 for chocolate chips): We got this to share between the 6 of us. They were fine, but I don't feel the need to get them again.  Toucan Louie's has good food at a reasonable price with large portions."

We sat on the covered patio and enjoyed a breakfast burrito and jerk chicken salad sandwich.  Afterwards, craving something sweet, we went inside to look at their baked goods and decided on a blueberry biscuit.  All the food was good and really affordable at under $10.

When we went to ask about it the staff proceeded to tell us that they touched our food and it was not cold. The fact that they said they touched the food then gave it back to us was not okay. Then they proceeded to throw our plates in our food away and cuss at us about the whole situation. It's not okay to do that to your customers. We did not yell or make a scene. We had a normal tone with them and they were very rude to us. I have never been to a restaurant where the staff threw the food away in front of us and to decided to cuss out the customer.

Today I ordered the pancake breakfast with blueberries and an omelette breakfast. I went in to pick it up and the older blonde lady behind the counter started yelling about how they didn't see the chow now order and didn't want to cook it. Then said ‚Äúyou're lucky I haven't tossed out the batter‚Äù, she was very rude. I think the guy at the register saw my face because he told me not to worry about paying for the coffee I had got while there. He was very sweet about it! When I got home I saw the pancakes had both blueberries and chocolate chips in it. All in all, better caf√©s to support in the area."

The pancakes were like eating fluffy dry air , I would rather of eat a rice cake in syrup than these pancakes. We all threw out our food instantly after taking a bite of everything , the one thing I did eat however were the grits (decent) but made my stomach curl afterwards ...by far the worst experience for breakfast in my life or any food I ever ordered for that matter!

I went here for my dinner meal. The chicken wings were HORRIBLE and by the time I got home cold as was the mac and cheese. It's against health codes to serve this type of food especially the temperature of it. I will be reporting it and they were very much aware of what they served because I tried calling back twice and no one would answer. Not to mention I was the only customer who they were fixing food for. I have been in the business for thirty nine years and this by far is the worst food I have ever been served. You deserve 0 stars"

I came for breakfast, and early in the morning it was just the owner running everything, and so the tables were a little dirty, but he was friendly and welcomed us in and brought menus to our table.  Side note, this is a police hangout. There were 2 cops waiting in the parking lot for it to open, and probably another 6 to 8 that stopped by while we were there. So don't speed anywhere near here, but it is definitely the safest cafe in Charlotte!  I had a coffee and the twisted goat breakfast sandwich. This place definitely isn't anything fancy, bit it's also not expensive. The coffee was no frills, bit definitely did the trick. The sandwich was a unique take on an egg and cheese, with peppers, mushrooms and feta that was reasonably good and well priced.  All in all not a bad spot for a breakfast meet up, won't knock your socks off, but probably won't disappoint either."

The turkey sandwich sets a new standard for Turkey Sandwiches: with hummus, roasted peppers, goat cheese, olives, spinach, cucumbers.... a magic flavor I cannot forget.  Owner Mark looks like an unlikely chef, but brims with passion for the food ‚Äî and drink ‚Äî that he crafts on-site, including the local ingredients he sources from his farmer friends.  All that plus craft beers and wine to accompany his all-day breakfast, lunch and more menu.  Thanks Toucan Louie's!   See you soon!"

You can get eggs pancakes toast and a side of something like grits for $6. But for some reason they also charge the same price for a lot of their single sandwiches (weird).  The food is good but on my last visit I got a biscuit and pancakes and was very disappointed. The pancake was just really dry and not very tasty as if they used no butter. And the biscuit they make now is apparently pan baked as if  they are trying to save money and is the worst tasting \"biscuit\" (if you can call it that) I've ever had. It's literally just bread that has absolutely no flavor. I would use store-bought white bread for biscuits and gravy before I got theirs again. This sadly is a deal-breaker for me. Outside of these two things I would definitely recommend the place."

The parking lot is small, but we came for lunch on a weekday and it wasn't crowded so we got a spot.  The ordering process was a bit awkward. The person taking our order seemed confused, but it all worked out.  We got the Chimichurri Steak and Cuban BBQ sandwiches with a side of mac and cheese, a lemonade, and a slice of apple pecan cake.  The Cuban BBQ was my favorite. The meat was perfect and I loved the slaw. The Chimichurri Steak Sandwich was good, but I didn't taste any chimichurri sauce which was disappointing. The cake was fantastic.  The only let down was the mac and cheese. It tasted like Velveeta cheese and just wasn't very good. I wouldn't get that again.  After we sat down and got our food someone came and made sure we had everything we needed. They also do free refills on their homemade lemonade which is really nice.  If you want a good sandwich and a relaxing place to hang out, this is your place."

            "review_text": "My first reviews of Toucan Louie's were positive, like other reviewers I drive by this everyday leaving work.  So when some of us from work decided to try it, the food was expensive but not terrible.  Mind you even my co-workers would tell you while I am not a penny pincher, I do not want to be over charged.  One of my co-workers and I went today because it is close, we had not been much since the price increase maybe 8 months back, so I think this was the third time in 8 months this is a change from 2-3 times per month. I ordered a peanut butter and bananna sandwich (includes a honey drizzle and seed) and an order of mac and cheese along with a fountain Diet Coke, the Diet Coke is almost always flat.  The price was $11.05, this is a ridiculous price and we will very likely not be back till someone can expense this on a business account.  Don't get me wrong I prefer to support small business and I have had conversation with the owners, but for lunch this is just to much money.  I think it is funny, with a lower price (but still to high) I was willing to go 2-4 times a month, with the price increase I may go every 10-12 weeks.  I figure when I was going more often he made more money off me, may have been smaller bites of money but would you raither make $4.00 profit per meal 3 times a month or $6.00 profit per meal 1 time every 2-3 months.  Now it is not just me, I have several people that I take to lunch with me on a daily basis, so now it is not that I do not go but at least three (sometimes more) do not go through the doorway, meaning even more money lost.  Today the owner came in because of kitchen printer issue, he seems to have problems with it and proceeds to throw some items in the back, this was very unprofessional, and it looked like it even scared/startled the cook.  I like the owners and wish them well, but the food is just too expensive for what you get in return.  I am sure I will be back but likely this is down to 1 to 2 times per year now. Scott W."

With that being said, we were not disappointed. We were promptly greeted with kindness. The menu is more than just the typical wings, tenders, and burgers. I love that they offer smoothies, juices, baked goods that actually taste homemade. We both had the pancake platter. It was delicious. I did try the apple pecan cake- DELISH! Better than these bakeries I've been to. Def going back. It was cool to see the rapport between the other regulars and the employees. They were very sweet and personable. Loved it"

Eggs were burnt, the ham was comped together like it was initially frozen like that. The pancakes were under cooked. My Mom wasn't impressed. The excuse was that the griddle was too hot. There is no excuse for brunt eggs. Still, service was friendly, and they replaced the eggs. However, they were still burnt but now not cooked. We just threw out the food and went somewhere else.

Definitely check them out; some of my favorites are the breakfast burrito, jerk chicken salad sandwich and the super freekah salad. If I'm not mistaken, I believe they also compost everything to keep as environmentally friendly as possible. Highly recommend. 6/5."

We got a \"That's Gouda\" and an egg pimento sandwich, each priced right at about $5.50, unbeatable deal in a town where a sandwich of this quality and size routinely goes for $6.50 and up. The sandwiches were amazing (the pimento cheese was delicious!). The staff is friendly and reminded us that most of their food offerings are made in-house and just about all of their other items come from North Carolina. They have an eye toward sustainability with their food containers/packaging (even straws) being compostable!"

When we first started going the food was more plentiful, now that they have a following it seems the quantity of provided food has dwindled. Today my peanut butter and banana sandwich only had a small amount of peanut butter. Also my mac and cheese side was just over half full. When we were first going there the side was packed whether you got beans, home fries (packed in), mac and cheese was a full cup, however the last couple times it has been very near half to just over half full. Mac and cheese, home fries, beans are all very inexpensive to serve, and I expect a plentiful amount.  The parking is here is terrible, you can't really fault the restaurant for this as they are making use of all available space but most frequently we have to park down the street or across the street.  While I do recommend the restaurant, and the food is good.  There value is not really there.  Will I continue to go? Sure, but just not more than once a month or so."

I also really appreciate that I can eat there and not worry about how my food was treated before it came to the restaurant since they use small, local farms to supply them.  The owner told me she toured a large, brand name poultry farm and couldn't stay more than 10 minutes- didn't even finish the tour. She said she grew up on a farm and couldn't stand the way they were doing things and how the animals were treated.  I appreciate that.  The food is REAAAAAALLLLY good, too. If you care about and love tea and coffee this is a place doing it very well. They roast their own and the tea guy is really into his craft.  I can't recommend this place more. Do yourself a favor and try it out!"
