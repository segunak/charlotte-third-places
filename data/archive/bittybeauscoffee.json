We were fortunate to visit when they were celebrating their one year anniversary, but I imagine anyone would have a five star experience here.  The coffee was top notch and they seemed to have a large menu of coffee and tea drinks both hot and cold. They also employ a large number of special needs staff that are a seamless part of the crew here. So cool.  We even walked out with a teddy bear and glass mug for free after spinning the wheel in celebration of their one year. Definitely stop by if you are in need of a coffee or a mood boost. This is one of the best coffee spots in Charlotte."

Street parking is easy and free for 2 hours, which is a BIG plus. I'm pretty picky with coffee, and I ordered a cold brew with oat milk and it was delicious. The interior of the coffee shop is decorated very modern and cozy. While business is busy, the environment is still pretty conducive to productivity and it's not too loud. Also, can't forget, the employees are so kind! Highly recommend."
