And they did not disappoint. I had the Philly cheese steak grilled cheese with the garlic parmesan tots. My son and his girlfriend had the Buffalo grilled chicken and tots. Because it's a food hall, you order your food and then find seating around the beautiful establishment. There are indoor and outdoor seating options. They give you a buzzer and give an estimated time of 15 minutes, but the food was ready before 15 min. It's all made fresh to order. My Philly grilled cheese was so ooey and gooey, it had that amazing cheese pull. The bread had the perfect outer crunch but soft inside. The tots come with a aoili for dipping. I was not a fan of the sauce but I am still dreaming about those tots. The butter sauce drizzled over these hot deep fried tots with the parmesan and garlic is everything. But if a grilled cheese is not what you want there are many other places to choose from. If I lived in Charlotte I would definitely go back to Optimist Hall and try more restaurants. Highly recommended!"

Twice I came, midweek, and it was super crowded that I couldn't find parking anywhere amount the seemingly ample sprawling parking areas. Plus, be aware there is a charge for parking which must be paid through an app on a smart phone, but the first 90 mins are free. This time I lucked up on a space as someone was pulling out. Once inside, it was a cornucopia of eateries and socializing areas. I pre-ordered food at The Dumpling Lady, authentic Chinese dumplings. It was \"meh\". However, I really enjoyed the atmosphere a converted industrial warehouse building with rustic decor, Indoor and outdoor seating and socializing areas, just a great vibe. Probably even better in warmer weather when the outdoors would be more enjoyable. I considered coming back with my bf or my ladies group but I just wondered how I could make that happen since the Biggest issue for me was that it was just sooooo crowded and it was a Thursday at 2:30pm... I cannot imagine what it would be like during prime time on the weekend?? Good luck, pack your patience though and ENJOY!"

They tell you you have to pay $5 if you stay longer than 90 min and $18 if longer than 3 hours. Cool no problem… except that when you text the number to start to pay they tell you don't pay now .. you pay after the 90 min .. so one would assume you pay at the end of your stay the amount corresponding w how much time you actually spent there.. except noo that would be too reasonable. They fine you $20 for not paying the $5 right AFTER 90 mjn is exhausted .. regardless of whether you end up staying beyond 3 hours .. it's ridiculous, nonsensical but worse than that .. it sets the consumer up for failure because the instructions given are not clear. They even have parking attendants writing down people's licenses in addition to their automated system . It's very poorly run so I definitely won't be going back any time soon! Juliet Galton"

The parking is why I'm only giving three stars. I had read about the parking prior so there was some pre-worry because of all the bad reviews. Here is how it works: you park, text a number and it tells you to check back in to pay after 90 minutes... There is no reminder mind you. You can use the parking meter but the only option there is to pay like you're staying past 90 minutes. The worst part is you see parking attendants circling the parking lots just waiting to write a ticket... I got to my car at 85 minutes and someone was standing there waiting to put the ticket on my car. What a joke."

For example, as an Indian, you'll find their Indian cuisine restaurant to be quite americanized and not authentic. Same goes for the other cuisines. Finding a seat is a nightmare, and if you're traveling in a group, definitely get a part of the group to scout out chairs to sit in once you get the food. If you're into food that's midly spiced (both flavor and heat) go for it.  Parking is changing, it's paid parking now. Parking is $5 for first hour and $3 for each hour after that. Seems like a lot for something that looks like a mall food court."

We got some empanadas from Felix's empanadas really good, a bbq sandwich from noble smoke they were out of brisket so pork it was and it was ok, some poke bowl from zukku and that was delicious plus we got some buns and soup from Bao & broth and was really good.  The tonkotsu ramen was delicious as were the pork buns.  We tried to get some food from a place called Mezeh but they were closed.  My wife had it before and she said their food is really good.  Prices are a bit high but it's Charlotte and everything is up these days and this will be my only complaint.  Can't really do much about that.  The atmosphere is great plenty of space to sit down and enjoy your meal.  You can sit inside for the AC or outside for the heat.  Great place to visit and I did see a place for games and stuff but like I said we got there late so it was closed."

There are a lot of new apartments nearby and these young people get off work, walk their dog and head to Optimist Hall for something to eat. The building is huge, full of natural light and there is a green space between two wings of the building that allow for outdoor eating and it is very charming. The food choice is so broad I'm not going to even try to include them all. I went out on  a limb to try something new and I should have followed my heart and got the tacos, but their are so many choices why wouldn't you try something new . So go push your comfort level and try the Ethiopian, Mediterranean  or Indian food or any of the other 40 places (estimate), if your not feeling adventurous get the tacos."

With a group of 20-25 people (including babies, young kids, teenagers, and adults between the ages of 25-45) every single person can find something they love to eat. My personal favorites are Botiwalla (Indian food and hands down my #1 pick of everything the optimist hall has to offer), Velvet taco, Papi Queso (grilled cheese stand), and Suarez Bakery & Barra (which i always grab a tres leches cake togo before we leave). I also really love the pet supply store. The bars all  have delicious drinks and the bartenders are fast and nice. The drinks are a little on the expensive side but I expect that for the area and they are tasty so i dont mind too much. All in all our entire group is always able to find a large enough area for all of us to sit, eat, hang out together, and have an amazing time! Whether you are by yourself, on a date, or with a large group I 100% recommend coming to the Optimist Hall!"

The host provided bagels and coffee from one of the shops. If anyone wanted anything else they had lots of choices. If you want to do this I suggest you go and scout out where you would want to be and how many seats you might need. It worked for us because we were there pretty early on a Sunday morning.

I tried Papi Queso for the first time and had the best grilled cheese from there. The pig Mac sandwich had pulled pork and Mac n chz grilled to perfection. The fries were hot, fresh, and perfectly crispy as well. Try out Papi Queso next time you're at Optimist Hall and you won't be disappointed!"
