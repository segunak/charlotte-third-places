The bacon wrapped dates and olive tapenade board DID NOT disappoint either!

Tuesday is half priced wine (by the glass!) so I definitely took advantage of that!  We shared the olives, the meatballs (tip: order extra bread), the short rib sliders, and fries. They were all solid choices—would order again!  We wanted to try the empanadas but they were out. Will definitely order next time!  Parking was easy on a Tuesday evening but on weekends it can be difficult when all the businesses are open."

I had the spinach mushroom and Gouda frittata which melted in my mouth and a peach Ginger mimosa that was absolutely divine. There was a live performer and an art gallery and even a secret garden to explore! This is not a place to \"grab a bite,\" it is to be savored and absorbed and have all your senses treated to an array of fulfilling aromas, sounds, textures, and sights. Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, I ordered a coffee with coconut creamer that is locally sourced and was prompted to buy a bag of beans to take home. The servers were kind and accommodating despite an extremely busy day. Kudos to the creators of this gem in NODA."

Background: I'm a Charlotte native and live in the Renaissance property in NoDa - I have been to Artisans Palate more times than I can count.  This Morning, 11:00AM Reservation for Brunch on my Birthday:  We got here at 11:06 with 2 people in our party that came at 11:15  Ordered a carafe of mimosas, coffee, and a cheese plate (small) at 11:10  Mimosas and coffee comes around 11:45  We order food and another carafe when those came at 11:45  Cheese plate with 3 cheeses (the larger version is 5 - this came at 12:00)  Food (3 BEC croissants, 3 fries, a bowl of grits, and a side of bacon) came at 12:30  Carafe of mimosas came at 12:45 along with the last plate of missing food for someone in our party (another BEC croissant)  My wife asked for the GM - who came over and told us she “checked the cameras” and that “we came in scattered” - she then said, that “people that don't pay their bill? That's a felony” without ANYONE in our party (we are all working professionals) alluding as much. She then asserted that “I don't care how much money you make.” My wife is a teacher, as am I.  This was the most embarrassing and ridiculous experience I have ever had at a restaurant, and bless our server who we tipped out in cash because she was a saint.  Poor management will be the death of this place. Sierra is going to make it unbearable and absolutey not worth it to come here. She's been here two months. Might be time to find someone new.  Happy Birthday to me?"

Catherine was like a magician making all the cocktails and Bri was super personable and made me a mean Frenchie's Do. Along with the service, the food was PHENOMENAL!! The white wine sauce with the mussels was succulent, I had to stop myself from sipping it from the bowl. The pork belly was so tender it melted in my mouth. The crème brûlée had a strong vanilla taste that I loved and was noticeably super fresh and delicious. The drinks were NEXT LEVEL!! I had The Colonel, a refreshing vodka and basil drink, the Frenchie's Do, a gin, raspberry, and egg white cocktail, and an espresso martini for dessert and I was blown away. The simples and cordials are made in house so everything is super fresh, all the cocktails seem expertly curated, and the techniques used are so unique I have seen nothing like it in Charlotte before. 10 out of 10 recommend!! Will be back again <3"

We came to this restaurant as part of the Tasting Collective's private dining experience.  All of the courses were AMAZING and one of my favorite parts was the wine flight that coordinated with each of the courses.  There was not one single course that I didn't love.  The courses that we had were:  Citrus Shrimp Escabeche, with grilled artichoke, arugula and red onion, Corn Velouté with butter poached crab, Three Day Pork Belly with blackberry hoisin, five spice fennel, and jicama, Slow Braised Lamb with figs and celery root-palm purée, and Sweet Corn Butter cake with figs and blackberries.  Having a sweet tooth, I loved the dessert course!  All of the servers were very knowledgeable and excellent with suggestions and providing additional information about both food and drinks.  Two additional interesting things that I liked about this restaurant, was the Secret Garden in the outside patio area (you really must go outside if weather permits—don't miss it), and the small art gallery located inside the restaurant.  I love how chef/owner Christa Csoka melds art into everything throughout the establishment.  Also available are prints from artists who have had art  exhibited in their gallery.  Everything is very well thought out and I can't wait to go back with friends for brunch.  I hear that they have an amazing Brioche French toast with Bourbon Butter or Maple Syrup!  On a side note, I loved that there is a comfy chair available for nursing mothers in the restaurant—very nicely done."

We saw the nice patio out front and heard live music.  When we entered we were so moved by the ambience and felt under dressed because we just got done working out. Minutes had gone by before we were greeted and once the hostess arrived she seemed overwhelmed. Her energy triggered ours and ruined our welcoming (hence the 4 star review). Once we seated ourselves at the bar, both bartenders greeted us. Ciara immediately acknowledged us while she was making someone else a cocktail. Water was given to us right away as well. That made a big difference in our energy shift. Ciara's energy was necessary and quickly changed the direction of our experience. Ciara also helped us with choosing drinks and they were tasty. We had two specialty drinks and two mimosas.  Ciara also encouraged us to check out the small art gallery and garden area in the back.  We definitely plan to visit this place again.  We will make reservations next time."

The good: The mussels were solid and the wife liked her cocktail. Waitress was very nice.  The bad: Took 20 min to take our drinks order despite only three tables seated, never received water, mixed drink was served with diet tonic after asking for regular, chicken sliders were cold, and never got our glass of wine. Service overall was slow and inattentive. Comparably priced to places like Ever Andalo, which is fierce competition.  I'll probably go back to give it another shot at some point. The more places we have in the neighborhood, the better. But it really needs a lot of work to stand out in an area with more and more options."

We got the olive tapenade platter, the rockin' sliders, and the potato/corn/pepper empanadas and everything was perfectly cooked and tasted so flavorful and delicious. The sliders were by the far the stand out as some of the best burgers we have ever had. We each got a cocktail and they were all so good and quite strong! We polished dinner off with the bread pudding and WOW! We don't even like bread pudding and it was perfection. Cannot recommend this place enough to anyone who is looking for a cozy neighborhood restaurant with an artistic flair that is serving up some truly delectable dishes!!"

My partner was in town visiting and we met up with two friends I haven't seen in a while for a fun reunion. TAP gave us such an enjoyable experience!  The Good: pretty much every aspect of our dinner was fantastic. We loved the ambience, in a unique art gallery setting, with live music that started a bit later. Service by Coco was phenomenal - I hope the business owner sees this and knows what an MVP Coco was for us. He dealt with a table full of ADHD adults like a pro, gave great food recommendations, and picked the perfect cocktails for us when our ADHD brains couldn't pick a different cocktail from the sizable menu. Even when the restaurant packed out, Coco remained attentive and never let our glasses go dry. The food and cocktails were all fantastic. We shared multiple tapas and some of the highlights were the bacon wrapped dates and meatballs. The Weekender cocktail was great if you like tequila. We finished with the S'mores dessert which was plenty for 4 of us! It was my partner's first time ever having s'mores and he loved them!  The Meh: nothing for us! As some have noted, it is loud in there, especially when the music starts. It didn't bother us but wanted to point that out as it could bother some.  The Bad: nothing! I can't wait to go back!  As the place is a a smaller restaurant, I'd recommend making reservations. I believe you can choose indoor or outdoor seating. Definitely check out the gallery as they highlight specific artists at different times, too. My favorite combos: food, drink, good company, music, and art…..The Artisan's Palate has it all!"

Having been in the restaurant industry for 3 decades a manager should have swung by. None of this happened. I guess you were too busy.

            "review_text": "We arrived at 10:08am for brunch.  As is written on the menu and website, brunch starts at 10:30.  That's fine, we could get our drinks and wait for the kitchen to open the brunch menu.  We had six people in our party and there were 3 or 4 tables sat when we came in and no one coming in behind us.  We were told by the hostess we could be seated at this one table as long as we could be finished by 11am because of a large reservation scheduled.  None of us had a problem with this as we were anxious to be getting home after a fun weekend in Charlotte.  Our waitress came out promptly and we had waters given to us, ordered our drinks and let her know we wanted to order off the brunch menu and we're obviously fine with waiting until 10:30.  She went ahead and took out food order so she could get it in right at 10:30.  Our drinks came out promptly and then at 10:34 the food started coming out.  By 10:42 all of us had out food except for an order of fries for one of our people.  At 10:47, we were asked by the hostess to move tables.  At this point, the fries had still not arrived and all of us except for the last member to recieve their food had finished eating at this point.  One of our members had already asked for a box for her leftovers.  Once we were moved to the new table, it then took our waitress another 3 minutes to bring out the fries (maybe the kitchen forgot them idk).  By then the table we Had been sitting at had already been cleared and reset.  We then requested a box for a second time for the member trying to box up the leftovers.  Our waitress didn't return until 10:58, without a box, and we were finally able to request our checks.  We received our checks at 11:04 and by the time we left, at 11:09 (again, we could've been gone by 11 if we'd been given our checks more quickly without the table move), the party for whom our original table had been reset had still not arrived and I believe the hostess had made a call to the representative for that party trying to figure out where they were.  We also never received a box at all for leftovers, so food went to waste.  I'm a strong believer in having a bird in hand is far better than two in the bush and find it exceedingly rude to have been asked to move tables before it was even the time we had been told we had until.  None of us were pleased with our experience and none of us will be returning to or recommending this restaurant.  The drink I had (mango mimosa) was tasty and all of the food was in general good, hence the second star, but the hospitality we experienced was lackluster and off-putting re being asked to move tables.  Not receiving a box for food would not itself warrant a poor review, but was one of the straws on the camel's back."

            "review_text": "When food meets art!!  What can I say I'm a fan . I frequent here quite often . Now often enough to tell you guys I love their brunch & dinner items .  They are located in Noda area . One thing I love about this place is the owner is a woman . In the words of Beyoncé we all know women run the world !!  Her name is Christy and she supports a lot of local artist ,she offers a lot of their canvas art work inside near the bar area with great selection of wines . Usually it's also a live band or music of some sort playing which is an extra plus . Oh & please let's not forget about the secret garden out back with pop up fire pits perfect for this now chilly weather . Might I mention this is the perfect spot to to go for a lot of spacious social distancing.  Drum roll pleaseeeee, now to the good part which is the food . Since I have been for both brunch & dinner I will elaborate on the items I had on both occasions . For brunch i opted for the French toast and flavored mimosa I chose the pear mimosa which was extremely delicious. The French toast was scrumptious & not your average French toast like you're usually use to in sliced bread form.  Din din was next level . I chose the thai chicken meatballs they are made with ground chicken, coconut milk, sweet thai chili, ginger, &cilantro. The red wine slow braised short ribs were the truth & the light lol. Never have I had them this way Milanese style Geechie Boy Grits, wine demi-glace, orange gremolata, & local backyard Sprouts arugula. Other items I have also tried here is the rocking sliders on brioche & the duck empanadas.  Man listen all of my dinner items were like a dream come true.  A party ain't a party without an awesome crafted cocktail to wash it all down and they nailed the drinks on the head ! Drinks I tried the Oh Shelia , only because my moms name is Shelia I had to have it & the Paratrooper lately I have found myself in love with bourban based drinks and this one did it for me .  I left here each and every time with a well developed palate for the food & drinks here . I consider this a hidden gem in Noda. Make sure if your in the neighborhood to check them out . One thing I forgot to add be sure to try the s'more board so you can try the s'mores experience outback near the fire pit it was super cool ."

            "review_text": "$82.62 for an asthma attack.  Food is good on its way to great. Will be back. Do not sit in the middle of the bar. They smoke drinks in front of your face.  Coming out of there I smell like I went to a club where they allow smoking, but only smoking spruce. This being done, without proper ventilation, is bad for the health of your employees and customers.  Please rethink this.  Pear salad arrived in a beautiful bowl, was incredible difficult to eat though. Every poke shifted the salad to the other side. Not sure what the word is, clay bowl was sealed and had no grip? Is grip the right word? Was  poking and stabbing trying to pick up some of the salad with the fork and the salad kept shifting around.    All the unintentional sifting, every small ingredient eventually made its way to the bottom of the bowl. Likely not the intended salad experience.  Pork belly was tasty. Pieces were a bit too thick and overpowered the purée. Again an issue with the actual plate (there is a theme here). Trying to cut the pork belly the plate was uneven, something was attached to the bottom of the plate. Feeling around, a heating pad was attached to the bottom of the plate? Very strange and a first. Interesting idea I guess, but should be removed when serving. Otherwise folks go to cut the food and well.. things shift and it's like a plates imagining of an earthquake.  Anywho, food is good. Wait staff was kind. Y'all are doing something special here. Keep up the good parts."

Everything we ordered was so good.  Understandably, they are short staffed which made the service very slow. The staff was definitely working super hard and it's not their fault. However, I was disappointed to see the owner or manager (not exactly sure who she was) taking her time putting up some Halloween decorations while there was a restaurant full of people. We were there for 1.5-2hrs and did not see this woman help her staff even one time or check on any tables/customers. Frustrating to see as the other staff were working clearly their butts off the whole time and could have used the help."

I was slightly disappointed by their brunch food as I had high hopes for it. I started with a blueberry mimosa which was good, and then followed it with a Chef's Brioche French Toast. While I was promised vanilla egg custard, the dish was more dry and heavy and did not have as much of that creamy layer I was hoping for. I also shared a Smoked Tomato Kale with my friend and it was pretty decent. All in all, I would say this could be a great place for a different meal."

We were placed in a tiny round metal table with uncomfortable chairs under a tent near the future DJ. The wobbly table had too many decorations on it to also hold our plates and drinks so we sat items on the parking lot. The waitress must have been new as she  offered me sides with my entree then came back later and said My meal didn't come with it. She brought me the wrong drink and we had to walk up to the desk to request our check after we sat with empty plates ready to leave for a show. The food was delicious including a cheese plate, salad and sliders. The price tag was rather high for the food, service and setting. Given the strong reviews I had read, I was a bit disappointed. I might be willing to give it one more try in the future. I did enjoy the sweet doggo with his toys sitting near us.  One more thing to add. I appreciate the manager responding and recommending reservations next time. The reason I didn't have a reservation is because your website makes absolutely no mention of reservations or a link to do so online so I interpreted that as none taken as so many places are becoming these days so when we arrived and asked if we had reservations I was disappointed because I would have made them if I had known better."

The waitress brought out my food and because I hadn't been there before I didn't know what their French toast looked like. It was in an iron pan on a board so not regular french toast. She also had someone else's meal in her other hand which was not what my husband ordered. So I didn't know she brought out my meal. It is so loud in the restaurant that you can't have a conversation with anyone so I could not hear her when she abruptly asked who ordered the french toast. I told her I couldn't hear her so she literally screamed at the top of her lungs FRENCH TOAST!!!! She was incredibly rude. Later as we were leaving this same waitress told us to get out of the way as we were telling a person in our party bye. Learn some manners!! And customer service!!"

I arrive about 10 minutes before and get sat, and that was the extent of our interaction with staff. Around 8:50 my friend shows up and I had still not been greeted by anyone. I wait about 10 more minutes and finally get up to the go the bar and ask one of the servers if someone could bring us some waters. She comes over, takes 2 water orders but informed us that no one told me she was sat. We were there at least 20 min in the middle of the restaurant with multiple servers walked by us and no one stopped to check in on us or ask if we needed anything. Other tables that came after us got sat and immediately helped. My other friend shows up around 9:06 and by 9:10 we still hadn't received our drinks and no one had come back. After about waiting 40 minutes, we get up and leave and decide to go somewhere else.  I've worked food service for years as a server, host, and busser and also understanding the short staff with the pandemic so I don't believe in being rude to staff or making a scene ever. We simply left quietly but I would have like to enjoyed a place where we made reservations."

The lady who took my order seemed a little short with her responses at first but I think it's because she is trying to provide the customer with speedy service. After I asked her a few questions, she was actually very warm and friendly and offered to make me a custom, dairy free, tea latte since they make all of their syrups in house and apparently, custom drinks are her jam. I also ordered the marinated olives and a smashed avocado on a butter croissant. Everything I had was delicious! My friend had the salmon/lox platter and it was great too. We sat outside and chatted for a couple of hours and no one rushed us out or made us feel uncomfortable staying for a while. Highly recommend checking them out. The place is also very clean and the local art is a nice touch. Always great to see the new exhibits. The bathroom was super clean and organized as well."

One of our specialty drinks came out after the food even.  The cheese plates did not have enough cheese for all of us (4) to enjoy a taste. We ordered fries and were told we had to wait an hour and then they never came out.  The shrimp and grits was pretty good but it did not look appetizing in the dish.  The food was expensive and when we got it was okay but nothing special.  The place looked cute but it was not very comfortable inside, a little noisy. We had to find the art display ourselves because no one mentioned it (we only knew there might be art on display from the website mentioning a featured artist) and we were disappointed it was just a room. Just disappointed in the whole experience that was a real let down from what we expected."

The staff were wearing masks and were most helpful to explain the way the restaurant worked. You order at the counter and the staff brings you your food and beverages.  There is outside seating in the front, sides and back of the building. The indoor seating is open-air, which is really great during this pandemic. You really should feel at ease dining here.  I had the chocolate croissant & the spinach, mushroom & gouda frittata . Both were delicious. The Bloody Mary was $5 and it was the best one I've had in town.  I can't say enough about supporting local, small businesses right now and I hope anyone reading this will make it a point to get out, safely and do their part! We want authenticity in our neighborhoods so please help support them during this time!"
