They infused sugar cubes which I will have to come back and try for sure. There also so nakery items and chips to pair with your tea. You can do a cup or a pot of tea. This is the original location; a second location just opened definitely will try and visit.  The 1st Friday of the month there is live music so I'll have to check out th calendar for 2022.  Out goodie bags came with samples but I also bought a tea tin- comes with 1oz of your tea of choice.  Very pleasant experience after a long day at work."

I had the whole experience with the ceramic tea set and instead of crumpets & pastries I had some sort of sweet potato bread that was insanely good .

Sherry Waters, the owner and hostess barista and master of ceremonies, is a local treasure who has collaborated with family and community to open this hearth space.  Natural light and greenery abounds here. If you dont have a book, there are plenty here to raise your vibe and the clientele is lively and warm. There are also nooks to be to yourself.  Oh! And these are great loose leaf teas; I usually have what Sherry is having because she has a way with using teas to bring balance. There are often tasty vegan and gluten free options for the baked choices and a couple of dairy free milks (SCORE!)."
