It wouldn't be so bad if they were not already on the expensive side, PLUS adding a $1.00 \"convenience  fee\" for the inconvenince of incorrect orders, plus delivery charge, plus tip for driver collected before delivery is made.

Right now, when you place your order you get a pager to pick your own food at the counter in the back. I'd suggest grabbing your table and waiting maybe a minute or two after the pager vibrates to avoid people crowding the counter. You may want to order ahead to save time. It takes a few minutes on your phone and I can almost guarantee that your order will be 100% correct versus placing your order at the register. Although, it is rare when they get your order wrong. If they ever do, is usually because another customer took your order. The food is worth it. Really! As a suggestion, because Panera Bread's menu is mostly Carbs, you may want to order the smallest size and then split with someone; just for portion control. You should be able to substitute non-dairy for most drinks. And your order can be fully customized to your liking or dietary restrictions. The menu works much like it does at Starbucks, as far as substitutions go. And please don't be afraid to ask for substitute. They're staff is very friendly and understanding. It may take you a minute to explain what you want but they'll serve you patiently. The bakery options change with the seasons, so you may want to try their pastries every once in a while. So far, they have the best Chai Late I've had. There's also whole loaves of bread that you can ask to be sliced thick or thin. My daughter loves their Mac & Cheese and the sprouted grain bread."

So much so I am now rethinking my life choices including ever ordering Panera again, but especially never ordering from/going to this location again! This went straight in the trash. First time I ordered they forgot to give me my cookie I ordered (it was a door dash order) but I made the mistake of giving them a second chance. They did worse this time around. Don't eat here. Panera overall isn't what it used to be sadly."

The salads were missing key items, lettuce was wilted and brown, the grilled cheese sandwich looks as if a 3 yr old made it and the cheese doesn't melt. Neither side of the sandwich was grilled or toasted...soft white bread. I make sure that I go to the Cotswald location and the food quality is 180 degrees different. I don't see how Panera chain can support a franchise serving such a horrible quality of food (every time we have ordered). I will drive any day in lunch hour traffic before I ever order a delivery or any food from this location. I should have read the reviews because it seems this location doesn't care about their customers or what they spend their money on."

Each employee I spoke with had an attitude, it would be a 1 star if they didn't at least also have some resemblance of manners and customer service here and there. My order had things I didn't order on it (I had asked about the chocolate chip bagel, but then switched it to a different bagel when I didn't really get an answer, and ended up with a chocolate chip muffie on my order and not even a muffie in my bag) Then I was given my bagel without being asked if I wanted it toasted (first time that's ever happened at any Panera I've ever been to) and when I asked for it to be toasted was the first bit of attitude I got, saying ‚Äúyou didn't say you wanted it toasted.‚Äù Like I said though, she didn't keep TOO much of an attitude, although it was definitely still there. Then when I inquired about the incorrect price I was given money back, but it was almost going to be half of what I was owed, I had to state how much it should be and that didn't even include tax. Then when I finally went to sit down to eat, I noticed I had cream cheese a full month past it's expiration date! When I took it back in, I did get an in date replacement, but no other offer or anything, not even an apology! So by the time I got back to my food, my bagel and soup had cooled, but fortunately nothing got stolen while I went to get my new cream cheese. Fortunately, other than the expired cream cheese and the poor customer service, the food was decent enough, which is why I gave 2 stars instead of just 1! Would have been much happier and possibly not upset at all, maybe just a little bothered by the situation, if more than the bare minimum and technicality's had been done about it, if anybody working there seemed like they gave a darn at all, about the service they are providing, that we the customers are paying for! On top of that, my first experience here wasn't much better, the order was also incorrect, missing the avocado in a ‚Äúchipotle chicken AVOCADO melt‚Äù I also received practically the same level of attitude and annoyingly poor quality of customer service. I let it slide and gave the benefit of the doubt the first round because people make mistakes and have off days right, well not when it's 2/2 horrible service and very obvious it because they don't care about the quality of the service they provide! I don't know how they have a 4.1 overall rating, because looking briefly through reviews it looks like I'm not alone with these experiences either."

When I arrived to pick it up, they said the customer called in to add more things on a second order and to leave a generous tip for the driver, and that they merged the orders together so they wouldn't have to assign a second Doordash driver. After I completed the delivery, my app only showed a $2.76 tip. Which is fine, a tip is extra anyway but that is extremely unusual amount for an order that large. So I stopped by the Panera afterwords and they told me yes there should've been a $47 tip that was on the second part. So after a night and day full of back and forth with Doordash and Panera customer service, it's Panera's own customer service that tells me the second part was processed as a store pickup, therefore the tip never entered the Doordash system to get to me, and whatever worker at the store kept it for themselves. That's theft. I know times are hard for a lot of us, but you didn't earn that money. I hope you're proud of yourself. Stay away from this Panera"

Sadly last night was unforgivable and I will not be returning.  My order for curbside was not ready after waiting for several minutes past the designated time so I entered and waited at the passthrough window.  The general state of the interior was unkempt and dirty.  The prep cooks wore their masks over their mouths but not their noses, frequently reaching up to adjust their masks or wipe their faces with gloved hands and then scooping their hands into salad materials or deli meats. While waiting I was casually informed they were out of bread (??) and I would be receiving chips with my soups and when the order was finally ready after getting into my car I realized the grilled cheese wasn't included in the bag.  Upon returning and informing the employees I was missing my grilled cheese they casually responded \"I know\" and handed me a crumpled wad of brown paper, presumably with the grilled cheese in it. Frankly this last issue was the wake up call I needed to realize this place is a health hazard.  I came to my senses and returned the food to the front counter, leaving empty handed.  Last night my family and I were all a little hungry but at least we weren't risking our health.  If the above review doesn't concern you and you would still like to patronize this place, please take my seasoned advice and always review your pickup order in full before leaving the store.  Nine times out of ten there is at least one missing or incorrect item."

I requested to speak to their manager who was flustered and left us feeling like we've caused him the greatest annoyance. We were served fixed meals but that's about it. No apology, no ‚Äúhow can we make this better‚Äù or ‚Äúhow about refund for your bad experience‚Äù? We left feeling like nobody really cared about their customers at this location. Not a good place to be; especially with wait staff frequently sleeping in patrons booths etc. Manager could care less about his customers and appears to hate his job."

Another food item we order came without it's salad dressing, and we were served with a plastic fork that broke, because they apparently didn't want to have to wash anymore silverware. Classy.

Hugely overcrowded, it was almost impossible to find a spot around a lunchtime. Staff is just ignorant - I had to specifically ask an associate to swipe MyPanera card. It was just noon and this location did not have bread bowls for soup anymore. After all another associate brings me someone's else order, puts it to the table in front of me and leaves without saying a word and even giving me a chance to tell her the order was not mine. Just plain terrible. This location - never again."
