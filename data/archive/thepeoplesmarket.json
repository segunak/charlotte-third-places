            "review_text": "Excellent experience. The space was beautifully reimagined from its prior design bringing in more contemporary elements of what we loved about The People's Market's original location, elements we loved about the former business in this location, and some new inspiration.  Pastries are baked daily, and you can even watch the pastry chef at work. The lunch counter menu has very reasonable offerings, and is ready for pickup very quickly. We loved our cheeseburger (a relatively simple double patty smashed cooked perfectly for what it was), our chicken torta (with a slightly artistic presentation but still simple and approachable), and French fries that would've come around $25, but we ran a tab and went from coffee to tea and seltzer throughout the afternoon.  Should you stay for a beer, there's an array of local taps. While there is not an excessive dried goods offering like some sundries/delis/ markets around town, there is plenty to choose. Additionally, the reach-in cooler space is full of items to enjoy on-site like alternative non-alcoholic beverages and local beers or take with you too like pasta and provisions dinners.  Easy to get in and out with street parking in addition to the parking lot across the street. Walking distance to many other shops, restaurants, and bars. One of the closest walks from Novant Health Presbyterian /Hemby Children's Hospital campus, Central Piedmont Community College. There is a CATS /LYNX gold line stop right in front of the place. Safe to say that I would recommend."

Highly recommend visiting this place! Great atmosphere, great food and great vibes. They offer breakfast all day along with lunch food. Breakfast is my favorite food so I'm glad to see a nice variety of it. Overall, we loved it and will return back for sure."
