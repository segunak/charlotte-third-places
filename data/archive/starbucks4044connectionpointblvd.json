Additionally, they were slightly difficult to pick up once they'd settled on the table for a moment, requiring one to either hold the corner of the page up from the table or spend several seconds trying to peel it up once I had finished signing. We had lots of pages to sign, so you could see how this would be a concern. The hot chocolate was alright."

Usually there's no problems when I grab our drinks and sometimes I get a friendly have a nice day, but today this girl was trying to give me another persons food and I declined because I only ordered drinks. As I was walking out, she yelled ‚Äúis your name Matthew?‚Äù  in an accusatory tone and if I was sure I didn't get food. I look at my drinks, the labels say there are only two items on my order and I know what we ordered.

As a local to this neighborhood, I was super excited to have a Starbucks with a drive through open nearby. The staff at this location has always been friendly. However, I absolutely dread coming here because it takes FOREVER. No matter if you order inside or outside, you end up waiting 10-15 minutes for your drink. Personally, I feel part of the appeal to Starbucks is their speedy service. Today the line outside was probably 15 cars long so I went to order inside and ended up waiting just as long. Not sure if it's a staffing issue. I know some businesses are struggling with that. Hoping it improves!"

Also they put the straws away so you must request one. For the last week or two they have had no large straws. I do think the manager must be concerned about a budget because the other Starbucks I go to in charlotte do not have this issue. The female employees are always super nice, but it's 50/50 when it comes to the men. Just a weird vibe that I have not gotten from any other Starbucks I have visited in charlotte and other cities. Hopefully this turns around, otherwise night swim coffee is about to open up and will be getting all my business."

Not even a apology! the employee didn't even care to ask what my order was. After getting their attention I stold them what my order was they still didn't even take the time to listen to me. Like I wasn't a paying costumer! So I asked for a refund and the gentlemen did do my refund but didn't even hand me the money. Just put the money on the counter and walked away. So a lot of things went wrong with my visit. Definitely needs a retrain in that starbucks. And will Not be returning to that store. All I wanted was my coffee so sadly I didn't get it.

I was expectant that they just had a learning curve to master since they just opened.. But it's been several months now, and as a frequent customer, I'm so disappointed. 7/10 times, my coffee is made incorrectly and I've had to instruct them how to make a very common drink order. The wait times are outrageous... On numerous occasions I have waited 20 minutes for a coffee when no one was in line at the store. The drivethru also takes ages, making it the most inconvenient option which is sad. The only way to get a coffee in a decent amount of time is to do a mobile order, even if you're sitting in the store ‚Äî and even then, there's no guarantee that your order will be correct.  I live less than a mile from this store and we have waited so long for this! I was so hopeful and excited... but this location has some major obstacles to overcome with training the baristas. I hope things can turn around."

The manager or shift lead we've dealt with seems so nice I think he's just as fed up. Today I placed an order for two coffees and a wrap and low and behold we got the two coffees, no wrap. We had someone else pick up the order and they were told there was nothing else in the order. I do everything via the mobile app now with them to help ease the confusion of the orders, so I have the proof of paying for a wrap.
