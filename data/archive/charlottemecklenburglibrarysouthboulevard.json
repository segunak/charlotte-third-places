Also you can reserve the computer with a library or guest card.  Even have a cute kids section for the youth to do practically the same things  Plenty of activities listed on the calendar üìÜüóìÔ∏è to not be bored and useful resources.

The library itself is right off of the main street, so you can easily miss it if you are going to fast on the Boulevard. That is about my only observed downfall, which motorists can appreciate if you are using GPS especially! Inside, the library was clean, organized, and had a nice modern feel. The help was friendly, and courteous. You feel the open space inside and will be able to take tour time with the purpose of your visit.
