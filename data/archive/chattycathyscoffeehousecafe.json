I got an Americano with coconut milk and hazelnut syrup with an extra shot my husband got an Americano with raspberry syrup and oat milk. They taste like the beans were over roasted and or there was not enough coffee flavor kind of like water down or day-old leftover coffee. So I went back inside to try to see what the resolution could be. She re-made the drinks of course using all of the same ingredients so in the end they all came out the same. So I don't recommend if you're a real coffee person I don't recommend chatty Cathy's on Causeway in Fort Mill South Carolina. There was no resolution other than just remaking the drinks. She got the $15 sale but I'm sharing my priceless experience. EPIC FAIL"

The young lady that took my order wanted to be absolutely certain that all I wanted was a plain cap, which I'm used to now, so it was fine. lol  The cap was pretty good. Good espresso shot and the right amount of steamed milk. My wife thought that the smoothie was not so great. Sorta like chewing on oatmeal, but we chalked it up to the healthy side of things at the counter.  The only problem was that service was profoundly slow after the order was placed. I don't know how many pending orders were placed when we arrived, but in the nearly 15 minutes we waited I only saw one drink arrive at the window. I was by no means in a hurry, but that's a long time. They also didn't announce when the smoothie was up, I just happened to see it sitting there when my drink was ready and asked if it was ours.  If we lived closer I'd be inclined to try this coffee shop in the future, but their hours combined with our schedule means there just won't be an easy enough opportunity to try to make it back."

Very cozy and and warm as you walk in and the staff were very friendly. I ordered a caramel latte with oak milk and my wife ordered the salted hazelnut with oak milk and both were equally delicious. Minimal bitterness, good mouth feel and not too sweet for it being flavored which was great. The food menu is where this place lacks but there's still solid choices. It's limited on sandwiches and what I ordered was good, I just would like more options to chose from but I understand it's a small shop.

Perhaps it was due to my nationality, but oh well, Starbucks was willing to accept my business.  Too bad, I really enjoy these types of coffee houses and was excited to try it."

I didn't really taste the flavors but I thought the latte was one of best I've had around town.  It wasn't overly sweet (I tend to drink it black but like something different when I go out).  I appreciated that it was in a mug since I was staying there.  The barista was not very friendly but hey - she made a good cup of Joe!  I love the rustic feel of the building and there are seating options.  I look forward to visiting again.  I met Cathy and she was very sweet and helpful when my friend and I asked some questions."

Being a coffee fanatic I can honestly say I was happy with our visit. The place has a great vibe with several spots to sit and chat or study and listen to music. The log cabin feel on the inside was homey and quaint. I got a shot of espresso, which was delicious and my cup of regular drip was well brewed also. The personnel were friendly and accommodating. The place was busy during our visit with people in and out but the staff was great to follow covid-19 precautions and kept everything disinfected and clean. All in all great visit and we will definitely be back!"

Also tried the sausage and mozzarella quiche. It was good but I don't think it was heated up for enough time. Some parts of it were cold but I was OK with it. My sister had an egg salad sandwich and said it was the best she's ever had!!"
