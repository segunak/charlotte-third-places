Yet, this was much more than a cafe (see pictures of food, books, and movies)!  The staff, like most Habitat locations, was very friendly and helpful. I learned that in the Charlotte area alone, Julia's cafe receives thousands of books each year which every folks can buy for as little as $1. But they have a special section set aside of rare books. Those books will cost a little more, yet nothing outrageous.  Now, they also have movies for sale which looked brand new and perfect for cold days like we have coming up. On the way in or out, don't forget to grab a drink or pastry which looked amazing.  I would definitely recommend stopping by!"

I needed up grabbing a vintage historical fiction novel I hope to enjoy from 1945 and in great condition!

If you're an espresso or redeye coffee kid like me...their dark blends are awesome! They do have Tea and \"frufru drinks\" both hot and cold. If you can answer the trivia question you get a very small discount BUT you might just walk away with some off the wall knowledge that you didn't already know! The staff is great and ... remember some are also volunteers. Donate your books...Help our community and learn something new for the day...ENJOY!"

I LOVE IT THERE :)"
