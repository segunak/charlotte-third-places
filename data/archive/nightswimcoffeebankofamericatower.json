And the coffee is as good as it gets, combining Not Just Coffee and Undercurrent Coffee's talent and experience, while also roasting the beans themselves. Love how everybody in the Charlotte coffee scene is friends with each other!!  Turns out the name Night Swim is meant to conjure nostalgic images of our youth, when we would float around carefree under the comforting caress of the moon."

Too sweet and no Masala flavor. Definitely will not be going back. It's priced like a specialty coffee shop with a mediocre product. I do like the interior though."
