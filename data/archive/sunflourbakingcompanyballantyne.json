We have experienced this slower pace a few times, so I wouldn't come for a breakfast sandwich if you're in a rush — but definitely come if you have some time.

            "review_text": "I have been frequenting SBC for about 4 years, always the Ballantyne location and once for catering. I am a HUGE fan of the food and drinks (see below), but there are some hiccups that others also have identified that can be frustrating.  First off, the food: fantastic (and I mean fantastic!) pastries, croissants, muffins, sandwiches and the like. I have never, ever been disappointed. I have had breakfast and lunch there on multiple occasions. I stop by occasionally for afternoon tea. I once even made a large catering order for the hospital where I work. Surprisingly, not a lot of people at work had heard of this place, but the food (sandwiches, salads and drinks) were universally loved and I know, for sure, that that catered lunch led to a number of new enthusiastic SBC customers.  For caffeine enthusiasts, their roasts are high-quality and they have a diverse offering of coffees (all from local CLT-area companies) and teas. The tea, Rishi, is quality, but overpriced at more than $4/cup.  I genuinely appreciate that they emphasize their local roots, highlighting local ingredients and promoting other local companies in their products. Hooray for the small guys! The staff are always friendly and as helpful as possible.  The one see where I think SBC can improve is efficiency and communication. When I tried catering, I had to call due to a problem with my online order. The person on the phone, located at the Ballantyne location, had no idea how to solve my problem and said, “sorry, we get no training for online orders.” I ended up paying more than I was supposed to. Similarly, in the store, i occasionally have long waits for items. More recently, I stopped by for afternoon tea. After 15 minutes of waiting, I went back up to the counter and the woman there sincerely apologized, saying, “I'm so sorry, I thought the other person had made it already.”  Despite these hiccups, which are human errors and mild in the grand scheme of things, I genuinely love SBC. I have brought many friends here, all of whom also have loved their products. I would highly recommend any time!"

I arrive at 3:00 pm and am promptly told by one of the employees \"Sorry, we're closed.\" After explaining to them that I am here to pick up my sandwich order which had a 3:04 pm pickup time, I was informed that they stopped serving sandwiches at 2:00 pm and only \"accepted the order to refund it.\" The communication (or lack thereof) was completely nonexistent and resulted in a waste of my time and money.  The best part, I was not refunded and my card was charged. So glad I have to deal with a credit card dispute tomorrow."

I have been to all of there locations in the Charlotte & surrounding area. This one continues to have problems. Their pastries are about the only thing that stay consistent. Their #2 is currently a pregnancy craving of mine, I add the basil/walnut pesto with avocado. I have been given the sandwich missing an egg, with an ice cold egg and no cheese, with the tomato pesto instead (which is not good IMO), missing the avocado, etc. It boggles my mind how EVERY SINGLE TIME something is wrong with the sandwich. Ive ordered online, over the phone, and in person. It doesnt matter, wrong everytime. This is the closest location to me and it's still 30 minutes away. I wont be going here anymore sadly and will just have to make the drive to the other locations. The staff seem like they mean well but goodness, someone has got to whip things into shape."

The wait time for sandwiches can be particularly long, especially at lunch. 2. I've been told 10 minutes after I place an order (and pay for it) that a certain ingredient/sandwich is out of stock. This specific scenario has happened more than once. I get it that everyone is having supply chain issues right now, but you could let me know before the order is rung up. 3.

Since then we pretty much try croissants at every bakery we can find to see if there is an equal or better croissant.  We're happy to announce that after 5 years of trying, Sunflour Bakery is STILL the number one croissant we've ever eaten.  There are only two other runner-ups at a place called Mocco Bistro and a place called Crema, both in Charlotte.  Interestingly, many of the other things we try at Sunflour are only meh and almost EVERYTHING we have at Crema is perfect so bear that in mind.  As for croissants Sunflour is the BEST"

Not only are they severely understaffed, but they are very unprepared for their customer volume. We placed an order on Saturday morning via their mobile app, and we waiting for our time to get our food.  Good thing we walked in and checked in on the order because they had cancelled our order without even telling us bc they ran out of eggs!!! How is that even possible? Prepare better.  Secondly, when I was giving the young girl a bit of customer feedback on having a better system of letting customers know if their orders had been cancelled (we received no notification whatsoever) - she was EXTREMELY unprofessional rude, and passive aggressive. At that point, I was stunned how she had spoken to me. Not only did she blame ME, the customer, but she couldn't just do the right thing in a customer service role and apologize for the delay and poor service. She copped an attitude and became very passive aggressive.  So, not only are they losing our business, but I am writing this google review to allow others to have a piece of helpful info before ordering from them.  Sunflour Baking Company - choose your employees carefully and wisely. If you do not instruct them on the proper ways to diffuse situations with customers, then they should not be dealing with them. If you teach them and they still do not adhere, then they should not be employed. It's as simple as that. I have over 15+ years in customer service and today I was completely and utterly amazed at how this girl spoke to me."

First the person that was one the phone had no idea what the flavors were that were available. I will note I  will take ownership that I did not ask how Much the order would be, but the price was not discussed. I figured it would more expensive than traditional cupcakes but goodness 20 cups were $87!! $3.50 per cupcake. A vanilla and/ or chocolate cupcake with pink frosting, nothing fancy!! If I had known I would have ordered 2 for the mom and then gone to Publix and gotten the other 18 for the same price as the 2? I don't get it. My husband said “ put the gluten back in for that price” also it's not like they were any bigger than a food lion/ Harris teeter cupcake. This was my first time getting anything here, so not impressed. Not to mention they were running so far behind I had to wait in line just to pick up the preordered cupcakes. The person on the register had no idea what she was doing and they were running out of things for other people who were waiting. So many people waiting on food. Again my first impression was NOPE!!"

And that's not even mentioning the fact that the inside actual cake was UNDERCOOKED and super dense and mushy (see picture). Here is the example they showed us and then pictures of the cake we picked up.....two stars only because they offer vegan cakes and the staff was friendly....."

I will have to return to try breakfast or lunch and a coffee selection.  One negative (which I don't believe is viable to change) is while eating we saw the restaurant across the way pulling catering pans from a van and just hosing them down and leaving on the ground beside the restaurants trash cans.  Just not a scene you want to view while eating: trash bags and cans and pans being rinsed with hose."

Recently I've had some bad experiences there because of how busy it is. I went in, spent over $11 for lunch and when I got back to work I found my order was completely wrong. I called, Stacey told me they had a $20 gift card waiting for me and apologized. I let it go and appreciated the customer service. About a week later I go to pick up my gift card. It was VERY busy, lots of \"mature\" aged people being very particular about things and asking loads of questions. I only get a 30 minute lunch break so I was in a rush to pick up the gift card then leave to pick up my lunch from somewhere else. I waited 15 min just to talk to the new girl at the register to get my card...she filled it out and I rushed out. An hour later I'm at work and pull it out of my purse and realize it's only for $10. So they messed that up to so my gift card didn't even cover the cost of the meal they screwed up. I haven't bothered to call again to rectify it. Again I will say the food is yummy but just so many screw ups lately makes me not want to go back when I usually go at least twice a week."

Ordered the avocado melt, out of avocados. I asked for an additional veggie to be put on my sandwich and she was extremely confused. We asked if the ham was country ham, or sweet ham. She said \"I don't know, I haven't tried the ham.\" And stood there, dumbfounded. We said \"anyone you can ask?\" She proceeded to ask the kitchen, \"has anyone tried the ham?!\". They had to read the package it came in, to let us know it was a boars Head honey ham. Asked for the a different sandwich on a cheddar biscuit. They say they are out of cheddar biscuits. The cook chimes in and says they just came out of the oven. We heard them tell multiple people on the phone and in store they were out, even after the fact. Bakery shelves basically empty. We were excited to come here. Poor experience.  Ps. no soap in the men's room. Water jug unfilled."

You order at the counter, find a table, and they bring your food out to you.  We got the bacon, egg, and cheddar sandwich on a cheddar biscuit, the frankly french toast (seasonal), and the black Friday panini. The french toast was my favorite. It had really good flavors. I also liked the bacon, egg, and cheddar sandwich. The cheddar biscuit was my favorite part. I thought the black Friday panini was just ok.  I also got a chai tea latte which was really good. It was spicy and not too sweet. My husband got a dirty chai in a cone. He was not a fan. He thought the cone made the portions off. You also pay more for the cone but get less drink.

To me a good cupcake leaves you able to eat another without feeling weighed down. They've achieved that here.  Also had Iced Cinnamon Roll- one of the best I've ever had. Again not to sweet, not dry- but not overly moist, cinnamonny, good size...this is what I cinnamon roll should be. Again...the right balance so that taking  a bite is satisfying...not \"too much\".

First of they did not have a lot of flavors like cupcake delirium did but I did try 1 cupcake first before getting a lot just to make sure it was good. The only one that I liked out of 5 cupcakes was the salted caramel chocolate cupcake one. I could tell it just came out of the oven. The coconut one and red velvet from the fridge was hard and just didn't satisfy my craving at all. It seemed like it was old. Maybe that's why it was in the fridge? I saw good reviews but maybe I just got a bad batch. It was not worth $3.25. I also didn't like that they didn't have special pricing for getting half a dozen or a dozen."

The place  Located in the a plaza they call the Quad it is in a really nice plaza in town with lets of shops around it. The inside is really nice. They have a good amount of tables plus a high bar top. Very well done and the bathrooms are clean.  The food  I had a Bacon egg and cheese on a Croissant. Can I say WOW!!! One of the best breakfast sandwiches I have ever had. I really wish I wasn't so full so I could have tried many of there amazing looking baked goods. I will be back to try them sometime. The only reason they didnt get a five star is due to my french press I ordered was luke warm. There is nothing worse than luke warm coffee.  The verdict  This place is nothing short of awesome I loved going here and I can not wait to come back to try some of the lunch options and baked goods!"
