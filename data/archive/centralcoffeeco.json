She had been a couple times with hopes that this may be the spot for us when I visit . I had a cortado and zucchini bread. The food surpasses everything else. Especially the staff. I got excited to see that the owners were mountaineers, (I am a mountaineer mom). Yet when ordering and initiating small chat in regards to such. They all seemed unbothered and could care less. It did take me by surprise that EVERYONE that worked there seemed miserable and unhappy . I even supported a second visit , after a 30 min drive , the coffee was good and the service was consistent with just , we could care less if you come or not. So with that being said, we will just take our average of 75.00 week coffee house spending habit elsewhere. Here is a little note to Central Coffee ..Customers still do come first somewhere. So my daughter and I will continue with our quest as it is obviously not there."

I also went there when I needed to do research and enjoyed the coffee and atmosphere very much. I often met friends there and told many people how much I loved Central. They have great coffee, great staff and a fabulous rewards program. I earned many free cups of coffee. When the pandemic hit and they were shut down I really missed the wonderful coffee but found I could order it and have it delivered. Ever since I have enjoyed Central coffee at home and brew the dark roast most mornings. Once they reopened I have been using the Odeko app to order my coffee every Sunday. It is a pretty easy app to use and I can order it ahead of time and by the time I drive to pick up my coffee it is ready fairly quickly. Today I did just that and ended up waiting for over 30 minutes. Customers who came after I arrived and ordered their coffee in person walked out with their cup of joes and I was still standing there waiting. I was livid. I never write reviews but I needed to get this off my chest. I'd like to say I am never going back but I know that isn't the case. I just wish they could have a better system right now.  They also claim to be short staffed which I find hard to believe with the amount of people out of work. Come on CC you can do better!"

During a recent visit to Charlotte, I was happy to have found such a nice little coffee shop within walking distance of the Airbnb I stayed in. Walking is good for you, but it's even better when you know there's a great cup of coffee at your journey's end!  There was a line each morning I visited, but it moved quickly. Employees were quite friendly, and one even complimented my Dwight Schrute themed RSVLTS shirt! Engaging in genuine, worthwhile small talk is an art that needs to be revived. These folks get it! And this location is also a good spot to catch a Lyft if heading to other points in Charlotte.  Hope to come back soon and maybe spend some more time in the shop, soaking up a bit more of the Charlotte vibe!"

I had been working inside for around 3 hours and got up to use the restroom. It required a key from the barista (which is fine). But when I asked, the barista, (who made my coffee!) questioned if I had bought anything in a very unpleasant way. I assured her that yes, I bought a coffee and I just threw it away in the trash can.  I don't write too many negative reviews but again, I do not recommend Central Coffee. Coffee was average, rude baristas, and tiny TINY parking lot with spaces in a super inconvenient arrangement.  How you treat people matters y'all!!"

I've had their pastries, bagels and more have all been delicious.  The coffee shop is cool, just simplistic and stylish.  There are plenty of tables for working or just hanging out, a side room that provides some quite space, and a couple lounge chairs.   There is not outside seating.

Well it is for me because on the sign it say a larger latte is 4:15 (before tax). If you gave out receipts then I could prove my point. The young lady at the register said ‚Äúlet me go ask‚Äù.. she wasn't gone 10 seconds and came back and said ‚Äúit's 5.09‚Äù..my response was ‚Äúwell either someone rang it up wrong on Saturday or the prices have gone up and you need to change your sign‚Äù. She said nothing took my money, wrote on the cup and went on to the next customer. Not even sorry that happened, or even thank you and have a good day. NOTHING...
