We spoke with one of the managers Paul to hear first hand how much good they are doing at this amazing cafe. We had a nice spread of food that included French toast, cookies, chicken sandwich, salad and ricotta toast. Out of all the food and drink options the chai tea latte was out of this World delicious and flavorful. The ricotta toast was creamy and with some tartness from the tomatoes. I will definitely return again not just because of how great the food and drinks are but because it is very rare you get to eat at a place that is doing so much good in the community."

Coffee was smooth and easy to drink Service was attentive but not suffocating. Food was fresh and tasty I tried their signature johnny cakes with pulled pork . I was apprehensive at 1st thinking it could be spicy but it wasn't it was so tasty and complex in flavors. My girl got the classic breakfast and was pleased.  The baked goods seemed a little underwhelming so we skipped that section  The mission statement for this cafe really warms your heart. We love food with a purpose and supporting local businesses that help the community like this one.  Check them out and be sure to go and support this amazing cause and get great eats in the process!"

Tho I'm partial to small and local businesses,  I have almost never had this kind of experience.  My partner and I walk into this breakfast spot and we were pleasantly surprised at the space this has. I did read the reviews and wanted in on the food that was soo raved about. Anyways. We get there and barely 2 tables are occupied.  We get promptly seated, get our bevs and that's about all we got for the 30/45 mins we sat awaiting food. Meanwhile, the restaurant starts to get busy and everyone who was after us get their meals. Even the last ones we saw sitting behind us. We had to flag down our server who was very casual about ' I'll go check in cuz things happen in the kitchen you know' and shrugs off never to be seen again! This was the 3rd time I flagged him down cuz the second was coffee refill. We left and wanted to pay for the bevs but the manager who when I was explaining what happened made me feel rushed to leave while looking around said our coffee and tea was on him. In the 10 mins of us waiting. Then leaving I never heard from the server or the manager not even when I waited outside for my partner to get the car.  I'm sure you're short staff but then that makes me think how did everyone else get their meals after you got busy? I have never made to feel soo dismissed and rushed. I can't think of any other reason but the very casual attire I was in - sweats and a hoodie while I saw everyone else all dressed for the day. Some of have a day off, too and like to be casual. Rest assured, we'll not be ever visiting here after a humiliating experience.  I guess I wasn't preppy looking enuf cuz I never found an actual dress code. Rr was clean and did smell good. I'm sorry at the whole meals being missed in your kitchen but it sure was not a pleasant experience for us by any means either."

I was blown away -- the atmosphere was amazing, the food was outstanding, the service was super attentive and the prices were really reasonable.  Located in an old mill building, it is rich with history and ambiance.  The menu is simple, but delicious -- absolutely do NOT miss the Brussel Sprouts -- the best I've ever had.  Next time, I'm trying the Fried Chicken which looked amazing.  The staff -- CLIENTS (that's what they call them) of the Rescue Mission.  These men and women are fighting to start their lives over and CRM is providing them with the skills.  What a privilege to meet them and encourage them in their journey.  They have a meeting room for groups of 20.  They are open for breakfast and lunch only.  They have outdoor seating.  You may want to call ahead for reservations to avoid a wait or to get a good seat.  I'll be back again and I'm bringing folks with me.  Not only will you get a top-level meal, but you are making a difference in the lives of important people who are on the upswing!  Don't miss it!"

They have a good variety on the menu, and I had their Cajun Sausage Skillet. The chunky potatoes were crispy and covered in peppers and onions. There was plenty of good andouille sausage, and it was all covered with a fried egg and drizzled with a spicy horseradish sauce. A thick piece of buttered wheat toast came on the side. The dish was delicious and filling, and the service was fast and very friendly. I highly recommend this place and am sure you would not be disappointed."

It was on the Yelp Charlotte Top 100 list and Best New Restaurants list in 2019, so clearly Yelpers know about it.  First off, I love that they're supporting Charlotte Rescue Mission. It's great to find restaurants with a great cause like this!  Covid-19: you can order and pay online. Pickup your food inside when you get there. They have a lot of outdoor seating, but it was crowded. We found a picnic table in the parking lot with no one else around.  We ordered the Pulled Pork Johnny Cake, Sugar Crusted French Toast, and the New Orleans Hot Chicken Sandwich with a side of Crispy Brussels Sprouts.  Everything was fantastic. I think the french toast was my favorite and the best I've had. I love how crispy and caramelized the outside was and how light and fluffy the inside was.  The Pulled Pork Johnny Cake was so unique. I loved the flavor of the corn based pancake and the pulled pork/egg was the perfect addition on top.  The chicken sandwich was perfectly crispy and delicous. I will say it wasn't at all hot so the name was a bit of a misnomer to me, but we loved it nonetheless.  We also got some pastries. We enjoyed the miso blondie, lemon cheesecake cookie sammie, and the molasses cookie sammie. The molasses cookie sammie was my favorite.  The inside is beautiful too. It would be a great place to hang out and get work done post Covid.  Don't make the mistake of sleeping on this place! Try them out for your next brunch."
