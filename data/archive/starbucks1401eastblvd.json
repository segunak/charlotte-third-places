Staff is super nice, and you can tell they work hard. However, my iced coffee has been missing the syrup 3 times in the last month - once in person and twice for mobile order. I caught it the first 2 times and they made it right.  The 3rd time I was rushed and didn't catch it.  One time, it had regular milk instead of cream and one time my mobile was missing the snack box, but not as much of a concern I suppose because mistakes happen‚Ä¶it's just the pattern that is taking extra time to have my orders corrected. I have tried calling the store multiple times with no answer to notify the staff so that they can be aware and make any improvements necessary, but cannot get an answer. If someone can address my concern from the this review, I would appreciate it and will be happy to change it to 5 stars with a glaring review."

I won't dive into the actual cafe environment itself, I don't have enough words for sad, empty, cluttered, drafty and dirty.  I will however point to the bathrooms, in which I'm attaching the photos. (sorry, gross I know.) If this was a one-off, that would be one thing. However, I walk to this location and it is always FILTH. You would find cleaner bathrooms at the abandoned Shell station in your hometown. I would be absolutely embarrassed to the managing party responsible for any of this.

I  have always ordered the same drink: a grande pink drink with no ice. Today when I picked up my usual order, the cup was half full. I asked why and was told that it was because they have premeasured amounts for a grande drink with ice, and they refused to add more drink to the cup‚Ä¶.. I paid almost $4.82 for a half full drink. Unbelievable! I have never had this happen to me before and they told me that they have ‚Äúalways enforced this policy.‚Äù Definitely won't be back to this location - sad."

The manager of this store has done a great job but if it weren't for their employees, this store would not run so smoothly.

            "review_text": "This is my favorite Starbucks in town in terms of layout, atmosphere, and design. The service however is inexcusable and probably the worst I have experienced. The employees aren't being trained for efficiency and are always slow-moving and seem to do tasks in odd orders. I notice that when making drinks they won't set them out as they are finished, but instead hoard a line of finished drinks on the back bar until they finish everything and then move them all to the counter. WHY?! It's frustrating to stand at the bar waiting when you know your drink is ready, but nobody is handing it over. Often the employees are swinging a towel around laughing and chatting (and not working). I ordered an ice coffee (black... easy) and then ordered a refill of the same thing an hour later. The first time my coffee was poured, but sat on the back counter for over 5 minutes while the barista finished other drinks. Eventually the manager came over and asked what I was waiting for and I pointed at my finished drink and said I was merely waiting for my drink to be within arms reach. Absurd. When I got my refill, and I remind you it is simply dispensing pre-made coffee and adding ice (a 15 second effort), my cup sat empty on the bar while three employees laughed and talked. The employee responsible for making my drink decided to take this opportunity to very slowly show another employee how to make a shaken tea. Why wouldn't that employee just pour the 15 second coffee and get me on my way before starting this process? I checked the time on my sticker to see how long I waited and it was 8 minutes and 15 seconds. For an iced coffee! and no it wasn't because the store was busy. The employees are just slow and have no multi-tasking or time-management skills. Having been to probably 80 different Starbucks stores hundreds of times over the last 15 years I can't believe how frustrating it is to experience a store that runs as poorly as this one all without apology. Eight minutes doesn't sound like a long time, but when you are just standing, silently staring at your drink and not being able to take it, it feels like an eternity. This Starbucks makes me wish I could just walk around the counter, pick up the cup, pour coffee to the line, add ice, and walk out. It's not hard. As I sit here I'm watching customers with grumpy faces stand with their hands on their hips rolling their eyes at the employees doing anything other than work."

The truth is, this has always been a common issue to find rude Starbucks baristas (in some stores all over North America and UK) dislike a certain customer for their personal, ridiculous, and superficial reasons.  They have unprofessional customer service, and immature behaviour towards customers who were never rude to the baristas in the first place.  They should not bully customers, and they don't deserve that treatment regardless.  They don't see that customers like this Trump supporter, still do business with Starbucks, and just there to get a cup of coffee.  I don't support the actions of these rude Starbucks baristas, not only how they treat the customer with the Trump t-shirt, but it shows a very bad impression of their service, ruining Starbucks business, and they clearly don't care for it.  #coffeenotstarbucksbaristabullies #stopstarbucksbaristabullies"

Staff was great, drinks were great... as expected. This one wins for atmosphere: both the inimitable building and the throngs of patrons who obviously love it there and stay.  It was an awkwardly chili morning in Charlotte when we came, but to an appropriate place it was. Plenty, albeit already occupied, seating throughout the building, as well as comfortable outside furniture reserved for those warmer days when one orders an iced chai latte instead of one extra hot with two sleeves.  Parking was a bit congested out back, but like the inside seats, there's plenty reserved for Starbucks if only less people came... a good problem to have, I guess."

If you are going the first time, even with gps, you might not see it, depending on the direction you are coming from.  It is on the corner of a busy intersection and all the parking is in the back.

Parked at Starbucks on East Blvd where United Towing manage the parking lot, got booted on a no marking parking space two minutes later when I walked out with my coffee. Call the number the person over the phone was rude and laugh over my request on filing a complaint. The towing staff was creeping on the corner of the lot waiting for any possible opportunity to charge people for their misfortune. They charge $75 for booted and 10% more for credit card, which is insane. The stuff knows nothing but charging you more. This is a despicable company with very in-respectful stuffs."

They have many comfy chairs at this location. Parking is a bear though -- DO NOT park in spots not specifically designated for Starbucks or you WILL have a boot put on your tire."
