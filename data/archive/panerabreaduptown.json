Their menu sign boards above the order stations state one price, but your bill is - literally - TWICE what the menu board states. A small (half) Fuji Apple Salad is listed at $4.69 on the board yet is $8.69 when you pay the bill! And that salad, for $9+ with tax, is so tiny, in a 4\"x6\" box, it wouldn't supply lunch for a child. When I realized the differential, I asked the manager for a printed menu to see what pricing is listed there, and he replied that there are none. I have reported this to the BBB and will take the complaint to Panera corporate."

Even though there is a pump for fake liquid sugar its disgusting and unsanitary and just not the same.  How many hands touch the pump? Today the fake sugar was out at lunch. Last visit there was no toilet paper in the bathroom at lunch. Tables arent wiped down often enough. 1 team member should just be wiping, checking, and stocking all lunch.

            "review_text": "Went there for lunch today and after three tries I still didn't have the correct sandwich.  First, discovered it had tomatoes on it after walking back to my office, so walked back over to get it fixed.  The associate at the counter was not friendly at all when dealing with it, so I asked for a refund.  The manager did come out and give me a refund and was nice.  He asked this associate to make sure I got my sandwich - as soon as he walked away she told me to just go around the corner and pick it up.  Apparently they took my food up front, because another associate came back around and gave it to me.  This time I checked and noticed there was no bacon on it (it was a Bravo Bacon Turkey sandwich), so I go back up to the counter.  This time the associate was nice and even joked around with me about the bacon being the best part.  When I go around to the pick up window one of the girls in the back was arguing with the expo guy saying she did the sandwich right.  If it hadn't been for me saying that it was missing bacon I don't know what they would have done.  This time I took my sandwich and went back to the office because my lunch hour was almost over by now.  When I get to the office, now the sandwich is missing the turkey and there are no chips in the bag.  I called and spoke with the manager who was apologetic and said he would be calling me back within a couple of hours and wanted to get more info at that time so he could get me a gift card.  Never heard back from the manager.  What this boils down to here is I understand we are all human and make mistakes, but for the most part the employees lacked basic customer service skills and had poor attitudes, which made me more upset than the sandwich being wrong.  A smile and saying you're sorry goes a long way.  Have never had this experience at a Panera before, but it was rough."

This location (as well as the location in CMC/Levine hospital down the street) apparently are needing some training as well as system updates, maybe? I placed an order online for rapid pick-up. It was set to be ready in 10 minutes. 17 minutes later I arrived and they had no trace of my order. I showed them the confirmation (still up on my phone screen) and was told they'd make it right then and there. Fine. I go to the front, order breakfast for my mom as well, come back 5 minutes later and I'm told \"We're out of that soufflé. It'll be about 20 minutes for the next batch.\" I have to be to work in 20 minutes. Nothing rapid about this here. Then I was told they have a four cheese soufflé so I agree to take that instead, only to have the woman turn around and tell me they don't have that either because they're selling it to someone else. Great. I was offered a breakfast sandwich. If I had wanted a breakfast sandwich, I would have ordered one. The manager agreed to cancel my order and issue a refund. This is the SECOND time I've had an issue with this location. I won't return but I suggest you fix it soon, Panera"
