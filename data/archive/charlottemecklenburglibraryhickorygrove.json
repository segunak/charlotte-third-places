But I only use the library computer room because my computer screen is cracked at the moment. But to be spoken to by a older librarian rudely on May 17, 2016 at 3:15pm at the Hickory Grove Library because she doesn't want to do her job is not welcoming or inviting. First she caught a attitude because I brought her my returned books instead of dropping them in the slot out front and then she told me next time \" I better\" bring my card because I got a temporary pass. I did not plan on coming to use the computer but being in that I am planning an event I wanted to shoot a email to someone and couldn't find my card after going back to my car to double check for it. I do not appreciate being spoken to in that manner. I said thank you and please, I am not a rude person and not one to bad mouth but I will not be talked down to because her conversation about her 72 whatever with the spoiler on the back to security be interrupted. Even though I did not speak but waited for her to notice me but got tired of security glancing at me behind her time and time again. I will not return to this branch again."
