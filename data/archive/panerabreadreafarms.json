            "review_text": "I have had several issues with this particular location. I do a lot of mobile orders and the first issue has been the wait. I've had to wait long times for my order to be brought to me. I've dealt with things running out and replacements having to be done which I understand. What I don't understand was my most recent experience. I decided to go in and pick up my order because I figured it would be quicker than waiting for them. When I went to grab my order it wasn't there. I had to wait to find an employee since I wasn't acknowledged at all. They seemed confused and almost made me feel like I was in the wrong. They had to ask other employees where my order was. When I told the employee my name again she responds ‚Äúoh we were out of Asiago that's why your order isn't there‚Äù we stared at each other for a minute and I proceeded to ask ‚Äúwell okay can I get something else‚Äù she replied ‚Äúyeah go the front and they will get it‚Äù. The cashier I had to deal with was a very sassy rude man. Seemed almost annoyed to have to assist me. I gave my selections and he put it in bag and was going to send me on my way. I asked for the cream cheese that I ordered which then he seemed even more annoyed that he had to go and retrieve that. On top of all of that I had to ask him for a knife. I don't want to make assumptions but I'm getting a bagel and cream cheese, a knife would be helpful. Being annoyed with this whole experience I asked him is their anything they can offer for the inconvenience. He replies ‚Äúum no‚Äù in which I responded ‚Äúreally‚Äù. He then hits me with ‚Äúand what would you like me to do?‚Äù In the most rude and snarky way. I grabbed my stuff and just left. This is unacceptable. I know places are short staffed but hiring just anyone is going to hurt your business. I do not ever want to deal with the rude people that were working that day ever again. Which is a shame because I work in the area and it was nice to have an option for lunch that used fresh ingredients. Shame on you Panera. Be better."

They were still open. I decided to look outside my door to see if the delivery driver was inconsiderate enough to leave my food outside the door. He was. It was outside of my door on the right of my door mat. I wish I didn't tip. He called me to let me know he would be late, but did not have the common sense to call when he was at my door. He either didn't knock, or knocked VERY lightly. I've never had a problem before hearing someone knock at my door before. I won't be ordering from this location ever again.

The entire experience was appalling from the cashiers lack of interest doing their job to the manager Adam. I have never seen a manager with such poor customer service skills. We had a large order scheduled for pick up today(order placed a week ago). We asked if it was ready, cashier checked and said it would be ready shortly. We ordered coffee while we were waiting. All 4 coffee urns were empty. Asked if they could be filled and one fresh urn came out. Poured the coffee to find that the cream and milk decanters were also empty. Took 15 minutes to finish making our cups. When we went to the food line area to inquire again about the order the manager asked the name and responded with \"we don't have an order for that name\" and proceeded to read 4 other peoples names with orders. Thank you but we don't really care who else orders, we just want our $125 order. He turned around and went back to working. I started that I had several email confirmations that my order had been placed at this location. Finally another employee took my order number to check on it. The same manager Adam came out with a large bag and dropped it on a bench and said it was under a different name as Regal. I said that it was not, I used my Panera account and that name is not close to mine. He said \"well I dont know but this is your order\" and turned to walk away. I asked if he was the manager and he said yes. I asked if he could at least pretend to care that i was in fact getting what i ordered. I told him i needed to check each item and he said \"Do what you want, have a good day maam\". Turned and walked away.  Service was absolutely pathetic and before I complain about the cashiers attitudes it needs to be stated that it's not their fault when clearly the managers negative attitude doesn't set the bar very high for a good example. An email is being sent to corporate with hope that someone will take a good look at what's representing the panera name at this location."
