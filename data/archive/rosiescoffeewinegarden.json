            "review_text": "The gardens themselves are beautiful! Atmosphere is is lovely.  However, having an event here is not the easiest. I was not the one who was hosting, but my friend was. I helped her set everything up & brought everything in prior to guests arriving. When we got there the seats were dirty, they looked like they had mildew all over them. I asked if they could be wiped down and the manager Jason (I think) yelled to someone on staff \"Hey! Can you wipe the seats down again, apparently they're still dirty even though we already wiped them down\" I defended my ask by saying they looked like they were outside when it rained & I was able to flick dried whatever it was off of the chairs. I was also told they were stored inside- wrongo- they are stored in their outside storage pod- so yes, outside so they were mildewy.  Jason proceeded to tell me that they had them professionally assessed & they can't be cleaned anymore they are permanently  like that. Which tells me, they are permanently dirty.  Then the catering arrived- which was some Publix deli looking sandwiches with no name cards so everyone had to guess what was in each sandwich. There was no cutlery, regular sized plates or the basic condiments that go with sandwiches. Then the wine that was previously selected for the menu was changed but no one informed the host. She found out by going to the bar to order wine & realized what she selected with the venue was not available so the event manager changed it to a wine that the host specifically asked to NOT have out.  The venue did not provide heating lamps, without a cost, although is a venue that is mostly outside. There was little to no light in the actual event space, the string lights & t-light candles can only do so much. The trash cans were full of trash from the last event, so we had to ask for them to be cleaned out.  As someone who works in the event & hospitality industry professionally, I might be a little picky. But my friend spent $750 + the required F&B min (which was over $1,000) on an experience that was not worth more than $500.  Was honestly disappointed on how a venue that hosts small scaled events regularly presented themselves so rudely & obviously disorganized. Which is a shame because the venue space is lovely- its everything else surrounding that made the experience not pleasant."

The only reason it did not get a 5 star review is because as I am drinking the bottle of wine I purchased I realized there was multiple price stickers stacked on top of each other. The price I paid was $35 plus tax however the sticker underneath said $20. While there are plenty of legitimate reasons to increase the price, I feel as if I have been cheated on a certain degree and for that I am not coming back.  I had recently wrote this post before talking to the store manager, and I do feel as if I have left an unfair review. The price was recently marked up because they had changed from their retail prices they were selling to grocery stores to in store purchases which had just re-opened to being a store in which you can purchase wine onsite and consume it in a lovely garden behind the store which they own."
