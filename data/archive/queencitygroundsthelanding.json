I've recently gotten the Impossible burger and the chicken sand-which and both are amazing. I recommend the ranch on both. The service has been much better and the food comes out in a timely manner. The staff is very friendly. Definitely give this place a try!  My experiences have been really bad. The first time I ordered a breakfast burrito, it took 45 minutes. They had given food to everyone else that ordered after me. I asked for a status update. Instead of telling me they lost my order or forgot, they just said they were still working on it. How? The second time I went, I ordered online, because I had a little puppy with me. I was working outside, since they had signs on their window saying they can't allow dogs inside. When I ordered online I asked in the comments for them to bring it outside since I can't come in. I waited 30 minutes, before realizing that they must not be bringing it outside. When I went in my order was sitting at the pick up window and they just ignored the note I wrote even though it was printed on the receipt. The sandwich was cold and soggy by the time I got it. Customer service is not their forte. I wanted to support their partnership with Summit Seltzer and new opening at night hours, but they need to work on customer service."

So I got the BLT but couldn't find any bacon on my first half of the sandwich but then I took it apart for the staff to show them I couldn't find Bacon. They showed me a tiny piece on the other half only and didn't seem to want to make another. If you're working on a menu and the first ingredient is bacon, you might expect to have a visible portion on the sandwich. Side note the online menu said on toast but the menu here was on a veggie wrap. Last part of my rant the item said thick cut bacon, the piece we found on one half was the same you see at Subway that's thin and small. I'll try again some other time, the menu looks great and has a lot of appealing options. The building is beautiful and they have a great decor. Thanks for the coffee y'all it was wonderful."

She ended up writing my name down wrong for the order I guess, so I obviously didn't respond when they called my name (there were plenty of other guest, figured it was theirs). Not a big deal, but the same lady finally came up to me (red dyed hair) and said ‚Äúwe've called your name like 5 times‚Äù as she delivered the coffee to our table, in the most disrespectful way possible. Then proceeded to roll her eyes as she walked off. 3. I clearly didn't know what name that they had down so the same thing happened for my food except she got my attention hollered at me to come get the food. Not a big deal, except, I finally mentioned that I think you got my name wrong, to which again she rolled her eyes and another staff joked that ‚Äúit's such a big deal‚Äù 4. Our drinks were labeled wrong (it was two drinks), so we each took a sip of each other's drink.  Lastly, one of these issues not a big deal, I get it people have bad days. But the lady with the red dyed hair is truly not meant for this job and this establishment will no longer get my business. I was a frequent customer, not anymore, this is pathetic."

They not only have options for non Vegans, but for those of us who are Vegan or willing to try it they've got LOTS of options for us which include a given number of specifically Vegan menu items, but the reality is that anything on their menus can be customized to your preference. They also sell my friend Morathi's product Kikaboni Sea Moss gel. I ‚ù§Ô∏è You Queen City Grounds!!!"

            "review_text": "I am leaving 1 star because I have to.  Worst experience in all my history of coffee shops.  The guy (who I thought was maybe a female...no name tag) at the register stood there pushing buttons on the register when I arrived appearing to be very busy despite the fact I was the only customer in line or waiting.  He didn't say \"one moment\" \"I will be right with you\" or \"can I help you\".  I am a nice guy, so I did not interrupt.  I stood there waiting for him to finish and after about 5 minutes, I assumed the machine was broke.  So, I spoke up and politely asked, \"can I place the order and pay in cash (no change needed).  He then looked up and very smugly said, \"I'm waiting on you to order, what do you want\".  I was instantly annoyed but, like I said, I'm a nice guy and let it go.  I politely apologized for the confusion and ordered my drink.  He was very rude.  Didn't tell me a total, flipped the screen around and walked away.  He whispered several times to the female making the drinks and they just kept looking at me laughing.  When it was done, he grabbed the drink and sat it on the pick up counter and walked away without saying anything.  The drink was horrible having purposely been sabotaged by the female under the man's instruction.  It wasn't an innocent mistake where it was not hot enough or too sweet.  It was not drinkable AT ALL.  I threw the drink away, looked at both of them, and walked out.  I sent two white coworkers there immediately after I left and they did not have the same experience and much better cups of coffee.  In that regard, clearly an isolated incident of racism.  Just a heads up to Management who may or may not be condoning this despicable behavior....this does not stop at my review.  I will be reporting this establishment and incident to the BBB, Chamber, CA, and any other platform to ensure everyone knows what to expect when visiting Queen City Grounds."

Queen City Grounds definitely has the coffee game on lock in Charlotte. The Flat White I had was simply the best cup of coffee I've had outside of my own home. It also helps that they roast their coffee beans in-house to meticulous quality.  The staff is super friendly, the coffee shop is always super clean, they also have some pretty tasty sandwiches, and the upstairs loft has some of the best views of Fourth Ward.  Come on in. Get a cup. Do some of that work you've been wanting to get done or just chill out for a while. On your way out, buy a bag of their beans to take home. And yes, they will happily grind it up for you."

The guy taking my order today seemed like he didnt want to be there, he was asking people if they wanted cream or sugar and then after someone replied cream please, he told them to go get it themselves at the self serve bar. Whats the point? Customer service alone is a 1 or 2 out of 5. Lets see how the coffee is.  Got the coffee. One was 4 shots, iced whole milk. The other 3 shots, iced, oat milk. I asked the dark curly haired barista if the milks were correct in the drinks (dairy intolerance) and she literally said, \"I forget at this point\". Not coming back, maybe find better baristas who care about the craft. I paid around $13 and a $2 tip."

Petey the Pistol was also good, but felt like something was missing from it. Hot sauce fixes just about all problems, so it just got better once it was applied. Queen City Grounds will be a recurring pitstop in the AM, and I recently learned that there are multiple locations.  Don't shy away from Queen City Grounds if you know what's good for you."

            "review_text": "Order: Cappuccino, Drip Coffee, Grits Bowl, Fall Toast Price: $19 Positives: Seating, espresso, they roast their own coffee Negatives: No pour overs (WHY DOES THIS CITY HATE POUR OVERS)? tldr: Queen City Grounds has fantastic coffee and one for the best interior spaces I've ever had the pleasure of drinking coffee in. Dispute their lack of a pour over I'd highly recommend Queen City and an exceptional cafe.  Thoughts: So if you read my reviews in order you know that I drove to this coffee shop from another coffee shop. Yes, we have a problem. Queen City Coffee was our second stop that day and a location we had planned to spend some time at working. It was actually very busy when we came in but we still managed to find some seating upstairs, and since I mentioned it, I definitely want to talk about their seating.  They don't have a massive amount of seating, but you could definitely get 30 to 50 people in this place without it feeling overly crowded. I think what really makes it feel less cramped is that the different places to sit are divided up around the shop. They have an upstairs area, a downstairs area, and several out of the way ‚Äúnooks‚Äù around the shop.. It really makes it feel like you're not in a crown even if there are a lot of people there. This would be a fantastic place to work or read while drinking your coffee  Now that we've talked about the space, let's move onto their coffee. They roast their own beans, which is a huge plus because it lets them control exactly what they want in their coffee. Once again I found myself unable to order a pour over which was even more bizarre at this cafe because they are a full blown coffee shop. It sort of left me wondering if Charlotte just hates pout overs. Anyway we got drip coffee, and one of their seasonal fall lattes. The flavors for both were excellent. The latte was very well crafted, it wasn't overly sweet and you definitely got that taste of espresso. The drip coffee was good, but it almost left me wanting a pour over because I think that would've pulled out the flavor more.  Since we knew we would be there for a while we also ordered one of their toasts, and a grit bowl. Both of them were killer! The grit bowl was very warm, hearty, and filling without feeling overly greasy or cheesy. The toast was one of the few toast I've ever seen my wife order that I also would have ordered. Most of the time toast is this weird artsy slice of toast and a little bit of something-or-other on top. Most of the time it kind of just annoys me that someone is charging eight dollars for toast and half an avocado. At Queen City Grounds this wasn't the case. It was a thick, flavorful piece of toast that tasted fantastic, had good body, and tasted homemade. You could really taste what was going on in the bread itself. Then it had this balsamic glaze on top with goat cheese and was really just out of this world. That's a very rare thing for me to say about toast so great job Queen City!  Clearly I haven't visited even a fraction of the coffee shops that Charlotte has to offer but of the three that I went to I think this is the winner. The seating and space is fantastic, their food is great, and their coffee was really good, reagardles of the fact that for some insane reason they don't do pour overs.  I know that my wife and I would both find ourselves here on multiple occasions to get work done or just hang out drink coffee and read."

Wish you the best but I would not return with this smell much more :(  Edit update: The place is easily a 5 star.  Amazing location in Charlotte, one of the best spots I've been to (not just in Charlotte) and very chill, really what a coffee place should be.  Thanks for the great job :)"

It was really crowded when we got there and there were about 10 people in line in front of us.  We got a pecan pie kronut and a lemon blueberry donut from Move That Dough. The donut was just ok to me. I'm not a big cake donut person, so it was good for a cake donut. The kronut on the other hand was amazing! It was flaky and crispy. So good.  The interior is gorgeous. They have a lot of seating too. There's an upstairs balcony with more seating too.  I definitely would come back here. Their breakfast menu looked interesting too."

It was all really tasty; not too heavy yet perfectly filling for a midday meal.  The establishment was very clean and comfortable.  I love the upscale yet cozy vibe they have going there.  The owl art on the wall is a fun touch and their upstairs seating area is perfect for some quiet space.  The staff were all very friendly and the service was fast.  Even though it was fairly busy, it wasn't too loud for me and my coworker to have a conversation. Really great place overall and I will definitely be back!"

They will validate parking up to 90 minutes for the parking garage as well. All the syrups are vegan as well. The environment inside the shop is very relaxed and chill.

I got it with tempeh and I can't wait to go back again. They have food options for vegans, vegetarians and carnivores including pastries.  They also sell small gifts including jewelry and greeting cards. They validate parking in the parking deck for 90 minutes. There is seating upstairs for overflow. You must go! Thank me later."

Also, when I went to ask one of the employee as to what's taking them so long, he completely ignored me. As if I don't exist. He finally served but never apologize for serving a cup of coffee that late. I decided to stop going as often as I do. I might try only once every two months."

The location is top notch, the decor is unique, the atmosphere is inviting, and the employees are so friendly and personable.  The coffee is fantastic! All options available as well (espresso, drip, latte, etc.), with all sorts of dairy substitutes if preferred. My understanding is that most of the coffee is roasted in-house, through Nightflyer Roastworks. You'll even see the roasting station right when you walk in!  The food is excellent as well. All the sandwiches and gelato are homemade, and it seems like more than half are vegan or have vegan options. I'm not even vegan and I can honestly say one of the vegan sandwiches I got was out of this world. The homemade gelato is a hidden gem as well.  This is the type of spot Charlotte has needed for years, and I'm so glad Queen City Grounds finally opened. You won't regret a visit here!"
