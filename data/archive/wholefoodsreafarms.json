Whole Foods Waverly is the best and it's all because of the employees.  It's the little things that I notice after spending hours and hours shopping here! One of my favorite employees is Aaron! He works diligently stocking the shelves and is always happy to walk with a customer if they're looking for something specific or unique. He has recommended so many new specialty products to me for a long time and my clients always appreciate when I incorporate new ingredients. He is a remarkable and dedicated team member. Jill is an associate that I see often as she shops for the online clients. If I ever have a question and she's close by she always seems to point me into he right direction. She's knowledge about so many products and I trust her recommendations!  Associates in every department throughout the store are always happy to be of service! I love talking with Cousin when I'm shopping for artisan cheeses. He's knowledgeable and I enjoy learning about the different stuff available and he is always so helpful.  I truly wouldn't be able to do what I do if it weren't for the team in the butchers market. Dan is always available to tell me about new selections as they become available. He suggests something different every now and then and never lets me down! He's always leading the team and takes special care to make the case look spectacular and it shows‚Ä¶Every time I round the corner I see the vibrant colors of the kabobs‚Ä¶they pop and catch your eye‚Ä¶and the meats marinating always draw me in to see what new flavors they are using. If it weren't for one of the other associates, John I wouldn't get the most consistent Ch√¢teaubriand roasts. He trims them precisely and ties them up perfectly so my job is practically done and they always come out perfect! A gentleman nicknamed ‚ÄúFish‚Äù  always has a great suggestion for the best method to cook specific cuts of meat. I've been cooking for 25 years and I'm still learning and it's guys like Fish that keep inspiring me. Mark and Matt just recently recommended the Bavette Sirloin steaks for some fajitas a client wanted me to make‚Ä¶I usually use Skirt steak and Mark was shocked that I wasn't familiar with this cut from the sirloin. I'm impressed with the difference and look forward to coming up with different recipes where I can use it.  I know I can always count on Whole Foods Waverly for the freshest seafood when I need it. Imad in the seafood shop is a master at his craft! His attention to detail is impressive and I really appreciate the extra touches he adds to the display case. He works proficiently and is extremely knowledgeable. I also enjoy talking with Jake about where the fish is sourced and his opinion regarding different selections. It because of them that I've tried to encourage my clients to eat something different from their usual.  Rich and Lizzy are just 2 of the team members that are always available to assist in the produce department. Rich takes pride in his displays and no matter how busy the store seems he and the team are always working swiftly to keep the freshest fruit and veggies available. Over the years I've seen so many new products available and they always seem to know quite a bit about where it's sourced & how it's grown.  As I head to check out I can always trust the front end team. Debbie Z, Sonia & Keri are just a few of the great employees that are always so pleasant and helpful with anything related to customer service.  I don't know who reads these things but I wanted to throw it out there‚Ä¶the entire team at Waverly should be recognized."

Didn't greet me or my mother, and gave me an indignant look as if ushering me to order something. Imagine being at work and rushing a customer? Disgraceful. How about cashier #230-6907, who was pushing my food down the conveyor belt and threw my receipt instead of putting it in my hand when I reached for it. She didn't greet us either. Never coming to this location again. The butchers on the other hand was extremely helpful!"

Of course I know what's going on with the whole pandemic thing but I have gotten sandwiches from other places this whole entire year and I just don't understand what the difference between pre-packaging for sandwiches or making me a sandwich right there.  it just doesn't make sense to me why that is not an option and if you are looking to go get a sandwich from there just know that this is not an option right now."

Food comes out fairly quickly. Love the ribeyes with sides of onions and mushrooms seasoned perfectly. When you ask for rare you get exactly that again the seasoning on the outside is perfectly done. Really enjoy their wings and the buffalo sauce on the side. Though this last visit I was solo so skipped them. The fried shrimp dish is great so was the sauce! Their version of Bang Bang Shrimp similar to Bonefish. Highly recommend them for a great steak and wing dinner!"

The noodles were thin (this one seems to be more of a preference thing but I prefer thick noodles). The toppings were served cold (unless you leave it inside of, not on top of, the broth). You are only given half an egg so you have to ask for the second half (eggs are also cold so they don't taste good). And, while I'm not sure if this is a good thing or bad thing, the broth was oily. The broth itself was actually pretty tasty and not overly salty.  All in all you can get better ramen elsewhere so if this is the only place you can go, and you really want some ramen, go ham but don't expect much if at all."

Quite a busy shopping center, and construction is ongoing, but the store itself is clean, with friendly staff, and a whole host of options to choose from, including a couple of restaurants inside the store!
