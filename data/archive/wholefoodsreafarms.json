The entire staff is friendly, accommodating , and offers helpful solutions. They did receive inventory the next day and ensured that I received my prime discount on my purchase. Good customer service is worth every penny. Thank you."

            "review_text": "If you don't love to grocery shop..you're shopping at the wrong store! I grocery shop several days a week for my work as a personal chef. Whole Foods Waverly is the best and it's all because of the employees.  It's the little things that I notice after spending hours and hours shopping here! One of my favorite employees is Aaron! He works diligently stocking the shelves and is always happy to walk with a customer if they're looking for something specific or unique. He has recommended so many new specialty products to me for a long time and my clients always appreciate when I incorporate new ingredients. He is a remarkable and dedicated team member. Jill is an associate that I see often as she shops for the online clients. If I ever have a question and she's close by she always seems to point me into he right direction. She's knowledge about so many products and I trust her recommendations!  Associates in every department throughout the store are always happy to be of service! I love talking with Cousin when I'm shopping for artisan cheeses. He's knowledgeable and I enjoy learning about the different stuff available and he is always so helpful.  I truly wouldn't be able to do what I do if it weren't for the team in the butchers market. Dan is always available to tell me about new selections as they become available. He suggests something different every now and then and never lets me down! He's always leading the team and takes special care to make the case look spectacular and it shows…Every time I round the corner I see the vibrant colors of the kabobs…they pop and catch your eye…and the meats marinating always draw me in to see what new flavors they are using. If it weren't for one of the other associates, John I wouldn't get the most consistent Châteaubriand roasts. He trims them precisely and ties them up perfectly so my job is practically done and they always come out perfect! A gentleman nicknamed “Fish”  always has a great suggestion for the best method to cook specific cuts of meat. I've been cooking for 25 years and I'm still learning and it's guys like Fish that keep inspiring me. Mark and Matt just recently recommended the Bavette Sirloin steaks for some fajitas a client wanted me to make…I usually use Skirt steak and Mark was shocked that I wasn't familiar with this cut from the sirloin. I'm impressed with the difference and look forward to coming up with different recipes where I can use it.  I know I can always count on Whole Foods Waverly for the freshest seafood when I need it. Imad in the seafood shop is a master at his craft! His attention to detail is impressive and I really appreciate the extra touches he adds to the display case. He works proficiently and is extremely knowledgeable. I also enjoy talking with Jake about where the fish is sourced and his opinion regarding different selections. It because of them that I've tried to encourage my clients to eat something different from their usual.  Rich and Lizzy are just 2 of the team members that are always available to assist in the produce department. Rich takes pride in his displays and no matter how busy the store seems he and the team are always working swiftly to keep the freshest fruit and veggies available. Over the years I've seen so many new products available and they always seem to know quite a bit about where it's sourced & how it's grown.  As I head to check out I can always trust the front end team. Debbie Z, Sonia & Keri are just a few of the great employees that are always so pleasant and helpful with anything related to customer service.  I don't know who reads these things but I wanted to throw it out there…the entire team at Waverly should be recognized."

Everything looked old and wilted. Meat window and seafood display looked pitiful too. I expect better from Whole foods. However, the bakery did not look too shabby. Hopefully, they improve this store soon so I can return."

Food comes out fairly quickly. Love the ribeyes with sides of onions and mushrooms seasoned perfectly. When you ask for rare you get exactly that again the seasoning on the outside is perfectly done. Really enjoy their wings and the buffalo sauce on the side. Though this last visit I was solo so skipped them. The fried shrimp dish is great so was the sauce! Their version of Bang Bang Shrimp similar to Bonefish. Highly recommend them for a great steak and wing dinner!"

The noodles were thin (this one seems to be more of a preference thing but I prefer thick noodles). The toppings were served cold (unless you leave it inside of, not on top of, the broth). You are only given half an egg so you have to ask for the second half (eggs are also cold so they don't taste good). And, while I'm not sure if this is a good thing or bad thing, the broth was oily. The broth itself was actually pretty tasty and not overly salty.  All in all you can get better ramen elsewhere so if this is the only place you can go, and you really want some ramen, go ham but don't expect much if at all."

I didn't let this mess up Whole Foods rating, however, I love Japanese and always want to try the mini restaurant in there. However, after seeing the boy wipe his nose using his sleeve, pretty much ruined my urge to give it a try.

            "review_text": "This is a revised review.  It's a nice supermarket with a great selection of meats, veggies, etc.  Originally this was a five star review.  But after a few months of shopping here, there is a pattern of overcharging that isn't a coincidence.  I only noticed it about 6 weeks ago, but it was most likely happening the whole time.  I rarely look at my receipt after shopping, but several weeks ago I noticed the 1lb of shrimp I purchased seemed pretty expensive, even by wholefoods standards.  When I read the label, I realized the 1lb of shrimp I purchased was close to 1.5lbs and they charged me for the premium seasoned shrimp which was like $5 a lb more.  I let it go and didn't pay any attention to it until a week later the salmon I purchased was the same deal, should have been about $12 a pound, but they charged me for the cedar planked salmon pieces which were like $10 each for a small piece, an $8 overcharge.  After that, I started keeping track of my receipt when I purchased there.  Fast forward 6 weeks later, I had to correct the checkout person on 6 different occasions for overcharging me on produce, choosing the most expensive version of it without even checking.  The final straw was today when I purchased 5 crowns of broccoli at $1.69 a lb and the checkout women charged me some premium version that was $3.99 a pound, it was a $6 overcharge for the broccoli.  Now I am not saying the seafood person or checkout people are in on some scam, but there is something seriously wrong with the patterns of overcharging for food that is overpriced to begin with.  I am happy to pay a premium for food that I perceive of as better, but I don't want to be ripped off either.  My advice to anyone is to check your receipt before you leave the store as I have been overcharged on at least 1 item over 50% of the times I have shopped there since they opened."

The produce department was lacking the luster of Whole Foods. For example, all the cucumbers were at least 2 inches in diameter, yellowish, and overripe. I wanted some fresh shrimp; however, all they had available was previously frozen shrimp. Needlessto say, I did not purchase shrimp. The fresh bread selection was not appealing like before. The baguettes, which I wanted, looked over cooked. Some of the hot food trays were empty. The clerk was nice, but unable to answer my questions. Overall, a very disappointing trip to that Whole Foods location."

Disappointed that they didn't carry items that I used to buy at Whole Foods in Minneapolis. Beware, the prices are high because everything is organic and this store is located in the vacinity of $Million homes.  A few miles away the Trader Joe's off Rea Rd is cheaper for organic groceries, but the store is much smaller and limited."

Very friendly employees, fresh and fabulous hot foods, and the meats and produce are always on point."
