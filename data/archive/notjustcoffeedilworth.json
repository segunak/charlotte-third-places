But no where on the website, on socials, in the reviews, etc. is it mentioned that laptops are not welcome. And the girl at the counter gave me a bit of an attitude like I should have known better...  Seemed like a cute location and the food looked yummy, but they need to give people a heads up before they arrive. Anyway, I just want to help other people out who may come and have the same disappointing experience. I left and headed to Stable Hand where food is served and laptops are welcome."

I did notice a sign at the register stating laptop usage was discouraged during the weekend however, the establishment does foster communication and dialogue as most people where having an actual conversation and not glued to their phones/computer. The chai was great, loved the cups and saucers, staff were friendly. Great ending from a trip to Charlotte."

They charge you ‚Äúextra‚Äù to top it off with milk. I literally almost got into an argument over this over priced drink with the manger. She refused to put ONE THIRD OF AN OUNCE of milk in the cup, to fill it to the top, and kept insisting that their coffees are ‚Äúmeasured out precisely.‚Äù Get out of here! They won't get my business anymore, and I hope they don't get yours. Coffee doesn't even taste great at that!"

I was here on a Sunday, when there were about 5 people total in the entire establishment, and I asked for the WiFi password. Big mistake; as posted on their numerous signs (almost one per table), laptops are not allowed on the weekends. I figured, well, the signs say something about making sure there's room for people having food, but 90% of the tables were deserted so maybe they would be reasonable about the rule posted on the copious signs? I was wrong. When I asked for the WiFi password (after I had bought something, not a big mooch myself), the barista kindly informed me that they \"unplugged\" the WiFi on the weekends.. I could see the network up, but understood he was saying that because of the no laptop policy and was even kind enough to overlook my laptop being out on a Sunday‚Äìwhen it's prohibited. I went back and kept working looking up what I had to look up on my phone.  I'm not trying to be unreasonable here, if I had been there and it had been busy and I were asked to put my laptop away so someone could sit/share the table I would gladly oblige. Even that would not be the best for building a customer base though. See, another way to see that situation is this, you're telling a paying customer to please stop what they're doing so another customer, who potentially may or may not spend more, can take their spot. Doesn't sound great for customer loyalty. What I do think is unreasonable is to deny yourselves the loyalty and dollars from people that would like come and do some work there, especially when the place is pretty vacant. The signs say it themselves, please avoid being on your laptop during peak times, sure that's reasonable; what's not reasonable is don't be on your laptops on the weekends, even if there's plenty of room.  It's a bummer, because I was really looking forward to making this a go-to, get some coffee, do some work, get some snacks, maybe a meal, some drinks, another coffee. Hope this may be a possibility in the future."
