My husband got a regular drip coffee which tasted like nothing. I ordered an Americano with sugar free vanilla. I watched the barista pour wayyy too much syrup in the cup (I was a barista for 5 years so I have a good idea about how much goes in a 16oz cup) and then watched 2 or 3 more drinks that were ordered after me get made and handed out before mine. They were relatively busy, with a line of 3 people pretty consistently, so I don't mind waiting for my coffee in those situations. However, the drink was so gross it didn't redeem the wait. I had my husband try it to make sure I wasn't being overly critical and he suggested I throw it away. We left and tossed our drinks and went to another coffee shop. Won't be visiting this spot again."

First incident was with a blond girl wearing a hoodie with a rainbow at the front counter; second incident was with a black man at the front counter.  Problem A: Both times when I asked for my drink of choice (\"Could I have a ____\") they responded with something to the rude tune of \"Yeah no.\" The second encounter I was thrown off by how dismissive he was; both times they just kept staring at me like I was the one who was foolish. How am I supposed to know what's out of stock? That's your job to inform me, do so respectfully, and perhaps offer a suggestion. So instead had to re-pivot and offer a second choice, without any input from them. Again just poor customer service based on their reactions.  Problem B: In that second incident, after I ordered, I moved to the right to wait for my order; a customer came over afterward and told me she had heard the blond girl and black man (at the front counter) talking smack about me. They were condescending to what I was wearing and how I wasn't entertaining their flippant manner with my demeanor.  Seriously have these two ever gone through customer service training? How can the Marriott endorsement this terrible behavior? The baristas here used to be so sweet (one used to remember my name) and now they're moody, condescending, and just awful to deal with. Will happily take my money to Night Swim or the cafe in the Ritz. Bye bye."

Wasn't much in the way of food but they had plenty of beer and a good selection of coffee. Ordered a chocolate muffin as well, waited 10 minutes before anyone said anything to me (mind you it took close to 5 just for the latte and there was one couple in front of me). The guy who asked had just gotten there while the guy who took my order was ready to leave but got told to clean lids and straws.  The environment is cool and plenty of seating. A very relaxed vibe. But the tables near the window hadn't been cleaned.  It's in a great location, especially for people at the Marriott, but not worth more than one visit.  Also...$15 for a French press!?"

The decor is warm and inviting, while still being trendy and fun. Every place invites a different vibe. There's spots where you can be productive while enjoying their coffee, or snuggle up with your honey and share a croissant. The bench along the windows facing the street is heated, and for someone as cold-natured as me, that immediately became my favorite spot. I loved it so much, I brought my partner back today. He got the house coffee and is still singing its praises. The bacon egg and cheese croissant was devoured in short order. I got an iced mocha that's delicious, and a smoothie (the Pitaya Pick-me-up, I think it was called?) It was fantastic and the next time we're in Charlotte I really want to come back and try out more of the menu- including the daily sandwich, which sadly wasn't starting until noon so we missed out. :("

The sandwich was overly salty and wasn't something I'd ever want again or be willing to pay that price for it.  It was a nice comfortable atmosphere, though they should remove that smoke thing with the Halloween decoration by the front door cause nobody wants to walk through that!"

Coco and the Director has the best, most consistent coffee and service out of all of them. We love the relaxed, welcoming vibe, the mix of spaces to enjoy (from toddler friendly to quiet corners for work or study to group spaces for gaming), and the absolutely flawless lattes. My husband and I have walked a well out of our way to go there many times now, and I've never had a cuppa, regardless of what I've ordered, that didn't feel like a warm hug on a cold day."
