They were quick to take the order as well as get it prepared. I got a campfire cooler and it was delicious on the hot summer afternoon! The service was with a smile. Don't forget to try a shot at the daily trivia question for a small discount. Great visit."

It's 5:35 and a woman just approached the front door and then turned around without entering. Perhaps it was the chairs on the tables. Maybe it was the guy vacuuming in the front window. Maybe it was the other guy sweeping in the other front window? Lol What a way to welcome people!"

I've never had a bad experience and I've been a Caribou customer for nearly 16 years (I need some stock or investment options). Truly a place that I enjoy going to because they make my coffee right (with all of my special requests) and it doesn't matter if I show up at 6:00 am or 6:00 pm. I kid you not, you'd think we are family when I bump into staff in the community. I'll be there daily with a smile, requesting my regular, and wishing them all well."

Caribou coffee is rainforest certified which places it in a wonderful category to fight the devastating impact some coffee growers have on deforestation. (Just my pitch as to why they are a great choice above others!)  This shop shares a space with the adjacent bagel place which provides some nice lunch and breakfast options. If it's crowded up front, make sure to check the back for more seating and a quieter environment.  There is free wifi if you want to stay for a while and even at peak times, the staff is very efficient to get ya moving!"
