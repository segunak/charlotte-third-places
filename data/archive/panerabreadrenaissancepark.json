When we walked in there was a line but the cashier seem to be just standing there. No smile, no greeting, nothing.  We decided to order from the kiosk which was easy to navigate. Once we placed our order I waited to hear my name to be called. There were several people standing at the pick up window so I stood with them waiting. The kitchen was very busy but well run by a gentleman with a beard. He was putting orders up as they were being made. Sadly he had to stop what he was doing to tell the cashier to stop standing around and clean tables on her down time. She pushed through the crowd without saying anything and the look on her face made it seem like she did not want to work there. She just stood at the pick up window tapping her finger nails on the counter. A few people approached and tried to ask her a question, she just shrugged and said she didn't know. Look, if you hate your job, I get it but at least act polite to your customers. Big shout out to the kitchen staff for being hit with 2 teams and still getting orders out. Our food was awesome and correct."

They just started opening at 6 which is even better for my morning routine. The only critique I have is that depending who is working the drive thru: your iced or hot coffee will either be mixed for you with your cream and sugar etc ready to go in your car‚Ä¶ or you will be handed a palm full of stuff and a full coffee cup. This is not conducive to tidy cars with no where to cleanly discard used packets of sugar or cream cups with no bag for trash since you only ordered a cup. Or if there is no room in your cup for add ins you have to find a way to pour some out. It would be nice to have a standard of mixing the coffee before it goes through the window - or at least consistently not mixing it so I know what I'm signing up for instead of an unpleasant surprise!"

I don't like that the duets mostly come with tomato soup (although this is a corporate decision). My cookies never look like the pics. I had to return a soup because it was only broth.

I ordered coffee; they didn't have any regular sugar only sugar in the raw.  This issue happens on a regular basis. I went there for lunch one day, tried to order a salad, they were out of romaine lettuce! A lot of people are still working from home and there are two new apartment complexes that were just built. How are they going to service the extra amount of customers if they can't even keep enough inventory now. I get so aggravated with them im not going back there again.

This location is about one third the size of a normal Panera, so be prepared that seating is limited. With the amount of offices around this location it seems to cater to the to-go orders instead of people dining-in. To accommodate the to-go portion they have about 10 parking spaces reserved up front.  They've got the food preparation and to-go portion managed well, however, because of the limited seating people seem to walk around looking for a place to sit. Not a big deal because of how good the food is but just something to be aware of. During the warmer weather they accommodate for the limited seating with outdoor seating."

Had they asked I would have requested plain white bread. I went this afternoon and ordered a TOASTED Tuscan chicken sandwich and the sandwich was not toasted. I called on both days and on Saturday the manager told me that the cashier doesn't see the picture outside to know what the sandwich comes on and picked ciabatta because it is the first one listed AFTER telling me they were out of the bread it comes on.

The turkey was really good, not your typical lunch meat, it looked and tasted like a whole turkey breast that was shaved into sandwich meat.  The service was good. We went on a Saturday, but I was the only one in the restaurant. The cashier was very friendly and welcoming. She didn't pressure me at all and allowed me to take my time reading the menu and answered my questions. All the rest of the staff was great, and my food was made in a timely and professional manner."

At 2:18pm I get home excited to eat, as I haven't ate anything yet. I ordered a caeser chicken salad with extra caeser with a fruit cup as a side. I actually received a caeser with a lot of chicken crumbs with a few larger pieces, one less caeser dressing than they usually give and the fruit cup was short on fruit and had no strawberries. I'm never one to call in and complain but I am and never ever going here again. The food was inedible and cost me just under 12$."

I was there for a hour and the tables were dirty, trash still sitting on tables and floors. Never saw a single employee attempt to clean it, including one young lady, in uniform, who flirted for twenty minutes with some guy right beside dirty tables, then left. Trash cans filled to overflowing, dirty dishes toppling over by the trash, drink counter covered with debris. As I left an hour later, two customers has to flag someone down in the open window kitchen because no one was at, or watching, the front. I go to the VA office the street, anytime I stop by here, its fairly typical, but today was bad enough, I had to review. I left at 4.00, the customers I just mentioned walked out a minute after me. There's hardly anything to purchase."

After about 5 mins or so another lady with what seemed to be a black eye (no disrespect) came back with my order with a sizeable amount missing. I asked about the difference and her response was we put two packets in and that's the size of what you ordered. Then I say if it's the best you can do, I need a refund for an item that's priced near 10.00. then one lady closes the door and a minute later the general manager comes over with another additional size of what I ordered and offers me an excuse for why the container was nearly 35% empty. I have frequented this location since it just opened and they have some good people. There was a friendly guy at the drive thru maybe on 4/2/18 and he exceeded my expectations just by being friendly and offering a nice smile and a thank you. I was not offered a receipt or thank you. I am in the service industry as well and the same behavior the general manager displayed could've been modeled by the  people also. Oh and the general manager did make a good effort to fix the issue and for that, thank you sir."
