(She speaks fluent French) So I whooped out my brain, iPhone, and did an extensive research. I came up with Am√©lies French Bakery that had a location near us and several others in Charlotte. I GPS'd to their Carmel location and put the emergency blinkers on as I waited outside while the crew were inside filling up boxes. When they came, I took pictures that looked pretty good. Little did I know my tongue hitting my head may cause a concussion when I took a taste of the first sample and I thought I was in France as they were so good!!! If you are looking for sickening sweet desserts, this is not for you. If you like European sweetness, Soda City can't compete!!! I knew something was up as I saw so many people coming out with boxes!!! The only error was my Son told them not to torch the top of his cream br√ªl√©e. He said he wouldn't turn it down again."

I was close by yesterday and had some friends coming to breakfast today so I drove to the store and bought one so I could serve something special. Baguette now is almost like plain white loaf bread made in the shape of a baguette.  Only special as to how disappointing to see how ordinary it is. LaBrea baguettes at HT much better, Bobby Boy Bakeshop in Winston Salem are the best I've tasted on this side of the Atlantic. Amelie, bring back the old baguette."

Well, let me tell you: we saw an employee walk in do #1, #2, and n#3. She came out after us.  My friend and I were using each one a sink to wash out hands.  This girl wasn't happy she had to wait, so she just grabbed a paper towel to clean her hands dry; no water no soap,no sanitizer.  We ran out of the bathroom after her to see what was she will do.  To our surprise she went back to  rolling and cutting dough without gloves and no washing her hands.  This is totally unacceptable.  If you work in a restaurant take your time to wash your hands.

Having lived in Bordeaux some years ago as an expatriot, I miss the French pasteries from time to time, and Amelie's satisfies that longing.  On this visit, my order was a few specialties for take home which included the plain croissants (authentic in my view!), eclairs, lemon macarons, and a chocolate mousse (fluffy and tastful). Ordering has been streamlined - on reaching the head of the line, there is an associate there at all times to take your order at left of the counter. If you are ordering pastries to go, another associate works with you to complete your order. The wait was short at 5 min considering there were 12 people in line and it was a busy Sunday. Service was friendly and attentive. In a future visit, plans are to dine here which can be indoors or on the covered patio on the right side of the cafe."

Every time I come, my French dip is ice cold in the middle. I always have to ask them to heat it. I'll even ask them when I place the order to please make sure that is heated all the way through. It still comes out cold. Last time I was here, the manager was nice enough to replace my meal and refunded the French dip. I came back again and still the same cold sandwich. I didn't say anything this time because what's the point? I dont want my money back, just some hot food. I'll just have to take the extra couple of minutes and drive to the Noda location."

Also, it didn't have ganache or mousse on the inside--just frosted between layers with the same frosting. There were no chocolate curls, instead little mini chocolate chips which kept rolling of the plate.  I've had good cakes from this location before, so I expected a lot more. It needed the mousse to offset the bitter dark chocolate taste. It crumbled when cut into. NO one finished their piece. Sad."

            "review_text": "I wrote a good review last year, but I have to agree with another reviewer who said that the offerings and quality on some of the bakery items have dwindled.  Like her,  I also visited about three months ago, and a few times since then, and the cases were practically empty.  I asked the employee if they sold out because of the holiday.  I was told that they were in the process of hiring three more bakers.  Lately, the cases seem to have a few more items than in the recent past.  It's not uncommon for me to take home an Amelie's shopping bag filled with boxes of pastries. However, the last two times I purchased the Strawberry Petit Gateaux, there was no cream filling!  The chantilly cream is the best part, but it was cake on top of cake!  TWICE!!! And I have to mention that the first time, the cake was dry.  Also, although the Mirror tart is delicious, it used to be so pretty with the swirl of chocolate ganache on top.  Now, the ganache is just spread on top and looks very plain.  I had lunch with my son there also, and we were both looking forward to having the Asparagus and Leek soup.  I told my son that it looked like they forgot to add the cream, and there was no flavor, as if they added unsalted broth and forgot the seasonings. The sandwiches on the croissants were good, though.  I have great memories of visiting the Flagship store in NoDa. That's where I was introduced to all the good food and pastries. The Carmel Commons location is closer to home for now.  I hope they can replicate the quality of the flagship store one day!"

The sandwiches we ordered were great, the $50 cake we pre-ordered and picked up was not. It looked fantastic until we cut into it, and then the whole thing started crumbling to pieces. The \"buttercream\" frosting was weird and cracked into pieces when we tried to cut it. We had a baker in the family that said they must have made the cake earlier in the week and frozen it (not surprising since they don't have a baker anymore). Not what I'd expect for $50. We won't be back to this location; hopefully they haven't let their other location fall apart like this one."

Mochas are darker like European versions rather than the typical sweeter American style  The real stars are the fresh pastries. Am√©lie's reminded me why people like macarons (small, colorful French cookie in multiple flavor options) since regular store-bought options are dry and bland. These are fresh and delicious! I also love their coconut macaroons... try both! Unlike the Uptown site, though, the staff wasn't especially friendly today. They also didn't ask light roast vs dark roast and didn't offer cream or sweetener, requiring another wait in the line. They weren't rude, exactly, just distracted I guess. I assume it was just the day since Uptown staff was regularly positive and friendly. Coffee and food were great as usual though."

Every time (three times now) I've walked in, just the looks alone of the treats, I can't seem to only get one treat. No, I buy like $50 of treats. As I said I'm not a huge fan of candy, so generally I'm not a huge fan of caramel either. Your caramel bars are insane. PURE INSANITY how delicious they are. That's stating an opinion of something I generally dislike.... if we go to the stuff I DO like... it's like going to heaven. If there is one type of candy I like it's dark chocolate bars. SO, I had your \"mirror(?)\" dark chocolate and raspberry treat, I LOVE dark chocolate, but I've never seen it used in anything but a standard dark chocolate bar. I actually got emotional eating it, I'm pretty sure I had visions. Thank you for the experience!"

The girl came out, cleaned a single table, rolled her eyes at my wife and went back in to hide in the air conditioning. I see a bucket of dirty water and a sign on it that seems to suggest that customers are expected to clean tables after other customers. No PPE like gloves provided. Seems like a violation of health code even in non-pandemic times. Food is still great, but small comfort when service and cleanliness are so far off."

            "review_text": "This morning my  husband and I pulled up for curbside service.  We parked in front next to the \"curbside service\" sign and phoned our order in.  We gave them our our order  (1 iced coffee, one hot chai tea) and they asked if we wanted to add a tip.  Feeling generous, decided to tip 20%.  They said to come inside \"in a couple minutes\"  to pick up our order.  I politely stated the last time  we were here (which was last week), they brought our coffee out. After all, that is what \"curbside service means\".  She agreed and said she will bring out our order.  Tipping 20%, I did not think this was unreasonable, especially since we pulled right up to the curb.  We waited 10 minutes in the car and could see no one walk in or out of Amelie's.   We waited another 2 minutes and saw a car pull up and another customer walk inside.  We decided to call them to make sure we get our orders first before these new customers.   We tried to call  and got answering service. My husband decided to walk in and they were not polite to him, saying that they don't do curbside and they never said they were going to bring out our order.   David said his coffee was lukewarm and they did not offer to make him another once due to miscommunication.  We will not be back.  It is a shame that Charlotte lacks good, independent coffee houses.  We don't know of any others locally... I guess we will be going back to Starbucks!"

I loved everything from the bakery case. The sodas are unusual, but spot on with flavor. As I said, hit and miss. But in the end,  I still enjoyed the experience of the visit and will return again.

The person behind the counter seemed like she didn't want to get me anything out of the case, but when I told her I did want some macarons, she did come over. However, she just stood there, she never asked if I knew the flavors or wanted to know the flavors, I'd already asked if they're gluten free and she said \"most of them\" but never clarified which ones. So, I had to point and ask the flavors and she seemed annoyed... not customer friendly at all.  I bought 4 macarons, but only bought the ones I asked about because she just wasn't helpful with the flavors. I know this isn't normal for Amalie's, so hopefully next time will be better, but I live out of state, so it'll be a while before I'm back."

The almond butter croissant is on üî•. You must get there during lunch otherwise the almond butter croissant is sold out. The people there are extremely friendly and laid back. The layout and feel of the location is like a Portland style barista with european roots. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the latte was okay.. while their sweets are delicious their coffee and latte should be matched. All in all I will be back."

I really do enjoy the coffee. and for the most part I enjoy the service. I am here 5-6 days a week and try to support small business(though I am on a tight budget) by buying something as often as I can afford to.  Having said that I do show up early. seating is first come first serve.  All of the regulars here know this. I do not appreciate being approached by staff interrupting my work flow just to tell me that the table I am at is a communal table and asked if I was willing to share. I am a grown adult and understand the etiquette of sharing a damn table.  Others approach me all the time either asking for chairs or to share the table. I am ALWAYS happy to oblige. I CAN CHOOSE WHERE I WANT TO SIT AND I CAME EARLY TO PICK THE ONE I WANT. DO NOT BE RUDE AND TELL A PAYING CUSTOMER HOW TO SHARE A TABLE."
