The interior has great vibes, we love coming here to play board/card games on their big tables, and they always have really unique and interesting beers on draft, like a PB&J sour, so it's fun to get a flight.  Giving it four stars (rather than 5) for two main detractors: 1. The food is unfortunately not great. I've given the food a solid like 3 or 4 tries and just have never enjoyed it. It just always feel really overwhelmed with toppings, and the flavor is never amazing. This might be a personal preference, but I prefer smaller diced toppings so you get a little bit of everything with each bite. Salud's pizza's all have thick cut toppings so you can only get one thing each bite, and you never really taste the cheese or sauce.  2. I just wish they rotated their draft beers a little more often!"

I'm a huge fan of milkshakes and sours and they have a lot of options. The classic Buffalo wings were delicious. Saucy and crunchy and their homemade blue cheese sauce is outrageous. We wanted to try one of the JonG specialty pizzas. It took almost an hour. Apparently they dropped it when it was coming out and didn't charge us, but it was a very long wait. I know the pizza is not so great in Charlotte but it was pretty good. The crust was crunchy and the toppings were great but I had a higher expectation. We had extra blue cheese sauce from the wings and dipped the crust in it - that was really really good. Highly recommend doing that. Will definitely go back. 🍕🍺❤️🎉"

There was a mix of people working on laptops & just casual Saturday drinkers. Vibe is very relaxed. Seating is large booths, couches or barstools. Shuffleboard table is really nice. Trendy decor- lovin it. Note: not a ton of seating if it's busy & large staircase to walk up. Unisex bathrooms."
