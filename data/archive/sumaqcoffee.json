We approached the counter to look at the menu and to of course place an order. We were never greeted. 2 young men whom I assume was a barista and maybe a cashier literally stared at us with a face of confusion.  After standing there for a few minutes without being greeted, my mother finally asked the guy about placing an order and he looked at her with a dumb stare. I'm not sure if there was a language barrier but the service was terrible. We chose to take our service else where after not feeling welcomed by the staff, which was a disappointment. I do. It recommend this space based on the poor customer service ."

The coffee is excellent, the staff is very friendly and helpful and they have both sweet and savory food, including the best damn empanadas colombianas I've had. The atmosphere is clean and bright with a touch of \"reclaimed industrial space\" and plenty of seating as well as a beautiful outdoor patio. The only negative is that the location is a little bit difficult to get to and parking is extremely limited, but those are more of a \"Charlotte can't city plan its way out of a wet paper bag\" problem. If you can get past that and make it in, you won't be disappointed."

Be aware that for near $10, the sandwiches are only enough for a small bite, so don't come super hungry.  Sumaq is great to camp out and do some computer work or for a cute coffee date."

I had one with fruit and it was delicious. I had the best iced coffee ever. I had it with almond milk and it tasted like coffee ice cream.  The atmosphere is  simple and inviting.

Free parking is available adjacent the building and there is also a large lot directly behind the building.  5.  Our food was delicious.  It took a while to prepare but it was worth the wait. We had the Wasi House and Gratin Lulan sandwiches along with a dulce de leche muffin.  They allowed us to substitute to fit our dietary needs.  6.  Even the bathrooms were clean, they smelled so nice!  7.  Give this place a try, you will not be disappointed."

Love the aesthetic also it's cute modern and has a great clean feel making it perfect to be productive!!! The staff is amazing and really cares that you enjoy the experience. Which today is HUGE. I actually got my coffee and accidentally spilled it all over myself within 2 min of getting it. I'm hey guy was SO incredibly nice and even got me a replacement even though I told him it wasn't necessary simce It was ENTIRELY my fault. But he insisted.  This was such a breath of fresh air and I HIGHLY recommend this place for a great cup of coffee and very looking forward to warm weather because it looks like they may have outdoor seating and it looks DOPE!! My only complaint and unfortunately it's a big one for me since I have sensorineural hearing loss (slight) the volume of their music is overwhelming. Heck, even if I had normal hearing I think this would have been a problem. I have noise cancelling headphones even and I usually can block out the sound but the music was so loud with them on it still actually hurt my ears. It was basicallt nightclub volume. I spoke to people next to me briefly and We had to talk pretty loudly to hear each other. I personally go to coffee shops to study or for meetings and unfortunately this isn't that vibe. As much as I WISH I could frequent here because they have great prices and ambiance for studying/meetings/coffee dates and are literally 3 min from my house‚Ä¶ it's just too much for me. I'll try again later down the line in hopes they turn the music to a level I can at least hear my own thoughts. But 100/100 recommended for coffee and great service!!!"
