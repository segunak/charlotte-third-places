Went in this morning and was \"helped\" by a kid behind the counter that was more interested in whoever he was texting than to provide much service.  Ordered the Nitro  Cold Brew - absolutely terrible.  It was flat with little taste - I saw him check the tank before serving which was a first clue.  I asked him about it not having the nitro foam you would normally get and he said that's the way they serve it.  Took it to go and ended up throwing about half the drink away.  We try to frequent non commercial chains, although today's visit at Mugs was a mistake that I won't make again."

I love the atmosphere and the cozy seating. The coffee is not the best, as other reviews have said, but I don't mind — I like most coffee.  Unfortunately, I've stopped visiting Mugs even though I live 2 minutes away. The problem is one barista (or friend of the baristas?) who hangs out there in the afternoons and is EXTREMELY LOUD. It's clear that people are there working or doing homework, but she can be heard at every corner of the establishment. I can even hear her when I wear my noise-cancelling earbuds. She chats with the baristas at the bar, cusses excessively, and talks negatively about her friends or her boyfriend. I can't get any work done there because I can't hear my own thoughts. Very sad to have to move on from Mugs."

It's a great shop to sit alone and catch up on some work in the company of strangers or to hang out with a group of friends. The staff is always super friendly and the drink menu is pretty extensive. You can get your favorite hot or cold drink in any flavor and they have a good selection of milk alternatives."

            "review_text": "Good coffee, pleasant staff and good food for a coffee shop. I try to avoid going to Starbucks as much as possible, so I am always on the hunt for a convenient place to get a cup of coffee, work or meet colleagues and potentially get a bite to eat, and this coffee shop checks all of those boxes.  I tried this location since it is centrally located between downtown and a number of other areas in Charlotte, so I am able to meet people from other areas of the city here without either of us having to drive too far (I am centrally located just outside of uptown).  The coffee is significantly better than what you might find at a Starbucks (though I do go to Starbucks as well when I have to). The staff is always very friendly and they will even take the time to educate you on things you might want to know when purchasing an item. For example, every time I purchase a coffee, they let me know that I can get one complimentary refill included in a purchase. While some coffee shops may do this, most won't proactively let you know since I assume they are trying to keep costs low.  For someone who loves coffee, this makes me more apt to purchase a larger size, knowing I will at least get my money's worth, especially considering the quality and taste of the coffee here is superior to other places I've tried.  I have also ordered food here while working and it is surprisingly good, especially for a coffee shop. They serve fresh croissants with chicken salad in it, which was very well done. The chicken salad was fresh (not frozen) and the croissant was well-made...crispy and flaky with a soft warm center.  Whenever I eat at Starbucks (which is extremely rare, mainly only in airports when I have limited time to get food and coffee), they warm up the spinach feta wrap from what was clearly made a while ago and is probably filled with numerous preservatives. Though it tastes okay, it is not something I would crave, while the chicken salad sandwich at Mugs is actually worth going back for.  Overall, I would recommend this place to someone who is looking for an alternative to Starbucks with better coffee, better food, good service and a comfortably working or meeting environment."

He is extremely experienced and knowledgeable in both barista skills and business management. He is an effective leader and a kind friend. Oliver makes sure that the quality of the beans and drinks we serve are top-notch, and I have not seen this quality anywhere else. Our customers are rarely rude, and the staff tries their very best to connect with our customers on a personal level. I cannot tell you how many names and drink orders I have had to memorize! My coworkers are hard working, unique, and great baristas. Everyone here is very mature and supportive of eachother. Mugs will always have a special place in my heart. If you are considering stopping in- please do! We will be very happy to see you! :-)"

Mugs is a popular place but it is large and spacious and you can always find a place to enjoy your coffee. You might think that good coffee, fast internet, plentiful parking and abundant power outlets are the best features of this place. That is until you meet the owners. Oliver and Belen are fantastic. They fast and efficient but above all they care about their customers, they are kind and friendly. They will remember your drinks and make you feel at home.  If you need to do some work, look no further, the music is tasteful and never too loud. Great choice to read a book, catch up with email or just sit and relax. In the summer, their vanilla ice cream is one of my favorite treats."
