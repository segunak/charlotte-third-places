# Charlotte Third Places

A curated collection of third places in Charlotte, North Carolina.

## Background

TBD

## Stuff Used

* NextJS
* TypeScript
* Python for interactions with the Google Maps and Outscraper API's in Azure Functions.
* React
* React Icons (instead of using just 1 icon library, why nto use any one you want while only having to install 1 NPM package. Lovely, just lovely.)
* AG Grid (amazing, just so amazing)
* shadcn/ui which is built on Radix UI
* Tailwind CSS
* Microsoft Designer (AI generated images, logos, etc.)
* OpenAI's ChatGPT
* Google Maps Places API
* The officially supported by Google <https://visgl.github.io/react-google-maps/>. There's so many other confusing options out there.
* Airtable to store the places data and the Airtabel JS API for easy integration into the site.
* Azure Functions to interact with the Google Maps API.
* Outscraper (getting reviews for amibeince analysis)

## Stuff Explored

* Firebase - Wanted to use it, got set up, abandoned. NoSQL is kil. Wasn't right for this project which is super simple data wise.
* Flutter - Started looking at it, was turned off by Dart, not because it's bad or anything, just in terms of investing in transferrable and in demand skills. Still want to make an app/site using it one day.
* React Native - Powerful tool, but my oh my, what a headache it can prove to be. Tamagui, Unistyles, React Native Paper, React Router, Expo, EAS, stuff not working on iOS vs. Android vs. Web. Working with React Native convinced me this project did not need to be an app. A website would suffice.
* Mapbox - While it has benefits over Google Maps, it was overkill for this project.
* Google Cloud Functions - Worked absolutely fine, I ended up moving to Azure Functions for other reasons, but this was cool.
* Supabase - Still looking for an excuse to use PostgreSQL hosted in Supabase, amazing company, amazing staff, amazing product. The data for this project is just way too simple for what Supabase offers. But idk, maybe a refactor just for fun one day.
