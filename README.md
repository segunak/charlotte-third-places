# Charlotte Third Places

Welcome to Charlotte Third Places—a curated collection of third places in and around Charlotte, North Carolina. Built and maintained by me, [Segun Akinyemi](https://segunakinyemi.com), this site is designed to help you find the perfect spot to work remotely, study, read, write, chill, or hang out with friends (or by yourself). It’s a place for those of us who value environments where community can happen naturally, outside the confines of work and home.

## Background

This project was born out of my own experience moving to Charlotte during the pandemic. Like many people, I craved places to connect with others, work remotely, and enjoy a good cinnamon roll. I found myself collecting my favorite spots, and soon enough, friends and acquaintances were asking me to share my list. Rather than send long, rambling texts with all my recommendations, I decided to turn that list into a structured, dynamic website.

**Charlotte Third Places** is my way of sharing these spaces with you while giving back to the Charlotte community. This is more than just a directory—it’s a place to help you find where you belong, whether you’re looking for a cozy café or a relaxed park to unwind in.

## Tech Stack

This site leverages a range of technologies to create a fast, responsive, and interactive experience:

- **Next.js:** The framework that powers this site, offering server-side rendering and static generation for a smooth user experience.
- **TypeScript:** Strong typing in JavaScript makes this project easier to maintain and scale.
- **React:** I’m using React to manage the front-end UI, including state management and user interactions.
- **React Icons:** A lovely tool that lets me use any icon library with ease, because why limit myself?
- **AG Grid:** An amazing data grid library that handles the complex tables on the site.
- **Shadcn/UI (Radix UI):** Provides consistent, accessible components, making the UI flexible and structured.
- **Tailwind CSS:** The utility-first CSS framework makes responsive design a breeze, and honestly, I love how fast I can build with it.
- **Microsoft Designer:** AI-generated images and logos brought to you by Microsoft's handy tools.
- **OpenAI’s ChatGPT:** I’ve used ChatGPT to help brainstorm ideas and assist with content creation—this very README was refined by it!
- **Google Maps Places API:** Provides detailed information on all the places listed.
- **React Google Maps:** The officially supported library by Google for embedding maps.
- **Airtable:** My go-to tool for storing and managing the place data. All the locations, attributes, and details live in Airtable.
- **Azure Functions:** Powers backend operations like API calls to Google Maps and Outscraper for ambiance reviews.
- **Outscraper:** A neat tool for scraping reviews and pulling in data to give you the best insights on each place.

## Stuff Explored (But Not Used)

I played around with some other tools before settling on my final tech stack:

- **Firebase:** While it's an amazing platform, it turned out to be overkill for this project. The simplicity of my data made it unnecessary.
- **Flutter:** Flutter is an exciting tool, but I wasn’t a fan of investing in Dart when there were more transferable skills to focus on.
- **React Native:** Great for building mobile apps, but the complexity of cross-platform issues convinced me to stick with a website for now.
- **Mapbox:** While I considered using Mapbox over Google Maps, it just didn’t make sense for the scale of this project.
- **Google Cloud Functions:** Worked well, but I ultimately chose Azure Functions for their integration with my existing stack.
- **Supabase:** I still think Supabase is great, and I’m itching for a project where I can use it. But for now, Airtable fits the simplicity of my data needs.
